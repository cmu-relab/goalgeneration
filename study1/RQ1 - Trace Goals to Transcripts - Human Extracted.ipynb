      "* Professional Communication - Primarily, Jacqueline’s email use is for career needs - receiving updates from recruiters, scheduling, and networking. Given this, reliable access to important emails from recruiters is critical.\n",
      "* Staying Updated on Academic Announcements - Another goal is to use email to stay current with university communications, from notifications to updates from platforms like Canvas.\n",
      "* Personal Organization – Other than goals related to school and career, Jacqueline uses email for organizing personal appointments (e.g., medical appointments) and to keep track of offers or discounts from merchants.\n",
      "* Organizing Inbox - She prefers a clutter-free inbox, frequently categorizing, deleting, or tagging emails to streamline her interactions and ensure that critical emails are easy to access.\n",
      "* Efficient Email Composition - Jacqueline values efficiency when composing emails and often relies on an AI assistant to make the process faster and more precise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Actions:\n",
      "* Checking Emails Frequently for Recruiter Messages - Logs in multiple times (more than 5 times) daily to ensure important updates are not missed.\n",
      "* Inbox Scanning and Cleanup - Jacqueline typically scans her inbox, marking emails that need action and deleting irrelevant or spam emails.\n",
      "* Tagging and Flagging - She tags or flags important emails that require future attention or follow-up.\n",
      "* Deleting Non-Essential Emails - Deletes email threads once they’re no longer relevant to keep the inbox clean.\n",
      "* Using Separate Accounts - Jacqueline keeps her professional, academic, and personal emails separate, which helps  in managing different types of communication effectively.\n",
      "* Using AI for Email Composition - Starts by listing her main points, then uses an AI assistant to generate the full message, which she then tweaks and formats as needed (e.g., bolding key points).\n",
      "* Multimedia Management - She prefers uploading files to the cloud and sharing links instead of direct attachments to make sharing easier.\n",
      "* Notifications for Priority Emails - Jacqueline values notifications but does not completely rely on them because of the potential for missing important emails.\n",
      "* Summarization – She performs manual summarization now. But also for future: desires a feature to summarize emails and highlight main points to save time on review.\n",
      "* Managing Categorization – She categorizes communication and finds categorization useful but also frustrating when important emails land in spam.\n",
      "* Monitoring Tasks and Deadlines - Uses flagged emails to manage time-sensitive actions.\n"
