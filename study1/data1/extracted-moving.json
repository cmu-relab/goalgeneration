Different normal length, that all of the articles have. So that is one that is one aspect that I that I would compare different sources. On. Another thing is timing. Major news corporations have a pretty good have a pretty good timing where they just. but they just like publish the news within the within a short amount of time of the event happening. That is a that is a great source. But again, it also depends on it also depends on the size of the publication. If it is a greater publication, the times are shorter, it is a larger publication, it is smaller publications. The times are longer. And again, another thing that I I think that I compare different sources are the stances that they take on several issues.

Do you find most useful.\n\nStakeholder: Yeah. The. So for the applications that I've been using to read news, Google news has been the the most used application. So one feature that I have that I found out to be the best is the recommendation. Oh. it tracks my behavior, I guess it tracks, and it tracks my behavior. It tracks my habits and it like, it shows the news that I am interested in on the Google search on the Google search page that that has been a great thing. And one thing that Google news does is it gives multiple sources for the same for this, for a similar news. So you don't get what do we say you don't get You don't get news from only one source, and you don't only see one side of that news you get to see multiple sites.

Do you find most useful.\n\nStakeholder: Yeah. The. So for the applications that I've been using to read news, Google news has been the the most used application. So one feature that I have that I found out to be the best is the recommendation. Oh. it tracks my behavior, I guess it tracks, and it tracks my behavior. It tracks my habits and it like, it shows the news that I am interested in on the Google search on the Google search page that that has been a great thing. And one thing that Google news does is it gives multiple sources for the same for this, for a similar news. So you don't get what do we say you don't get You don't get news from only one source, and you don't only see one side of that news you get to see multiple sites. And another feature is the notifications that I get from the Google Google news app or the Google News website. The notifications are pretty much, very they are. they are not they? They don't spam a lot. And the notifications that I get are pretty much are very useful. When I when I click on them.

I think there should be. There should be a feature to disable the topic like we have an Instagram where we don't like some reels or some post we are, we are able to. We are able to see less of those. There should be a feature that will that will also do this for news.

Thank you for agreeing to participate in this interview the purpose of this interview is to understand how you use Linkedin as an professional networking platform. This interview should take about 5 to 10\u00c2\u00a0min. Your insights will be always valuable in understanding the user experiences with Linkedin. So let me start with a simple question, what is Linkedin to you?\n\nStakeholder: So Linkedin is, I mean, in my view, is mostly a kind of networking platform. There's kind of a couple of key things that I do on it. But by and large it's, you know, viewed as a professional networking platform, which is, you know. in parallel to a lot of the other social media. It exists out there just to allow kind of professionals to connect and you know, live in the business world.\n\nInterviewer: Perfect so when you use linkedin like, right so what do you try to prioritize on the platform and maybe can you dive deep on. Why doing? Why are you doing that?\n\nStakeholder: So some of the things that I do on Linkedin are going to be networking just connecting with other colleagues, or maybe kind of past classmates see what they're up to. We do a lot of marketing especially in my field. We work with a lot of other professionals. In some areas, you know, marketing the exposure, there is far better than we might get, you know, through Google ads or Facebook out of other channels. So we focus a lot on marketing. We do a lot of recruiting as well through Linkedin. just good source a lot of people. And it's fairly low cost compared to some of the other competitors. And then even looking for jobs for myself. Yeah, sometimes it's nice to kind of poke around. See what else is out there in the world, and just see what some of the salary ranges and things like that, you know, always keeps you motivated. So it's a nice resource to be able to just again keep an eye or ear to the ground, look around, and then the last is probably events. A lot of organizations will post, you know. Hey, we have an upcoming conference, or we have this or that, and you know I I don't really. I drink from the fire hose of emails and there's no chance that I would be able to otherwise keep up with everything. So it's nice that when I have the availability, and I think I, you know, can have the bandwidth. I can go on and check and see kind of what events are, you know, being put on the community.\n", "goals": ["Enable networking with colleagues and past classmates.", "Facilitate effective marketing exposure.", "Support recruiting efforts to source people.", "Provide job searching capabilities.", "Display salary ranges for motivation.", "Offer visibility into upcoming events and conferences."], "phrases": [{"goal": "Enable networking with colleagues and past classmates.", "phrases": ["networking just connecting with other colleagues, or maybe kind of past classmates see what they're up to"]}, {"goal": "Facilitate effective marketing exposure.", "phrases": ["We do a lot of marketing", "marketing the exposure, there is far better than we might get, you know, through Google ads or Facebook out of other channels"]}, {"goal": "Support recruiting efforts to source people.", "phrases": ["We do a lot of recruiting as well through Linkedin.", "good source a lot of people"]}, {"goal": "Provide job searching capabilities.", "phrases": ["And then even looking for jobs for myself.", "kind of poke around.

Yeah, that actually leads me to the next question. Right? So in a professional setting. How does Linkedin contribute to your overall professional development?\n\nStakeholder: So for my own professional development. I can't say it's actually played that much of a role. I think a lot of my career has been. you know, word of mouth. A lot of the jobs or kind of the opportunities have been, you know, through existing networks or kind of continuing to expand. So it's in terms of kind of professional development. It's mostly to just signal to like my other to my clients, for example, that I I. You know I exist. I'm a person who, you know, has credentials, and I have, you know, degrees, and it just lends a little bit of a you know. a bit of credibility. And so it really doesn't play much of a role in terms of professional development. It's more of just a you know, another resource for people to check in and just make sure. Okay, I'm not like a Scammer. I'm not a, you know. If they get an email from me I am who I say I am, and the picture there matches the picture that they see on, you know, Zoom, or or you know, when I meet in person. So yeah.\n", "goals": ["Network with colleagues and past classmates.", "Focus on marketing for exposure.", "Recruit professionals effectively.", "Keep informed about job opportunities.", "Stay updated on salary ranges.", "Participate in community events.", "Signal credibility to clients."], "phrases": [{"goal": "Network with colleagues and past classmates.", "phrases": ["networking just connecting with other colleagues", "maybe kind of past classmates"]}, {"goal": "Focus on marketing for exposure.", "phrases": ["We do a lot of marketing", "In some areas, you know, marketing the exposure"]}, {"goal": "Recruit professionals effectively.", "phrases": ["We do a lot of recruiting", "just good source a lot of people"]}, {"goal": "Keep informed about job opportunities.", "phrases": ["looking for jobs for myself", "poke around.

Got it? So when you talk about Linkedin, right? So what specific features of Linkedin do you find most useful? And maybe why on that.\n\nStakeholder: I think the place I'd start is one. I think a lot of the marketing resources are are pretty good. I mean, they do charge you an arm and a leg. So I think cost is definitely a consideration there. But I do think that their reach and the network itself is good, and then some of the tools that they have to like post you know, marketing things are are very, very easy and user friendly. So kind of makes it again, a good tool for any sort of broad based marketing you can get, you know, pretty targeted. They have like recommendations. You can pay to have it be recommended a little bit more. And that process is just really simple. They just tell you here's how much it's gonna cost. And you know, here's how much it's gonna get boosted. So you can kind of keep track of all your impressions and all of your different marketing metrics. So I think that is kind of place a. And then the other thing that I found really helpful is, I did like when they purchased Linda, which was their kind of e-learning platform. You know, there is some kind of helpful stuff. If you want to do kind of a quick, deep dive into a certain. You know technology stack, or you want to kind of get a better understanding of like, how do I, you know, do something in marketing a little bit better. that was actually one of the better places to go, because in terms of quality it would definitely exceed. You know what you might find on Youtube or some of those other resources.

And yeah, it just felt like a more, you know, professional and polished place to to get that information.\n\nInterviewer: Exactly. Exactly. It makes sense. So can you walk me through the process of using Linkedin? Maybe for one of your typical professional task.\n\nStakeholder: Sure. So I think the task would probably be kind of posting, marketing information are posting like a marketing post just for awareness. So let's say, I'm at a conference. And yeah, something interesting is happening. Typically what we'll do is yeah, post something about it. So to do that kind of. I'm gonna walk through this, you know, as I'm looking at it. What I would do is log in. And at the top there's a big button. They make it very easy. You can't miss it. Which says, just start a post. and from there I can choose because I operate the Linkedin for my company, as well as for kind of my special profile. I can toggle between one or both, so if I'm posting as myself. I would choose myself. I can write my post. and they have, you know, a couple of little tools where I can embed, you know. images, videos, or, you know. kind of create a little more pop and circumstance, like nice backgrounds and emojis. And then, when I'm done I can hit this post button, or I can schedule it for later. So there's a nice little clock icon that allows me to say, All right. Actually, you know, most people are going to be logging in, probably tomorrow morning. And so it doesn't really make sense, you know, in the evening, to post it. It's just not going to get as many impressions. So I'm going to be posted at, you know. 9 Am. Tomorrow, when people 1st show up at the office, and I'll get a nice kind of boost in some of the impressions. So once I've posted it, it goes out to the network and it's on the feed, so I'll start to kind of get some interactions. And you know. hopefully, eventually win some business.\n", "goals": ["Provide user-friendly tools to post marketing content.", "Offer a simple process for purchasing targeted marketing recommendations.", "Keep track of marketing impressions and metrics.", "Enable learning about specific technology stacks or marketing methods through high-quality e-learning resources.", "Make it easy to start a new post.", "Allow users to toggle between personal and company profiles for posting.", "Include features to embed images, videos, and customize backgrounds in posts.", "Provide an option to schedule posts for a later time.", "Optimize post scheduling for maximum audience engagement."], "phrases": [{"goal": "Provide user-friendly tools to post marketing content.", "phrases": ["some of the tools that they have to like post you know, marketing things are are very, very easy and user friendly", "they make it very easy.

So can you walk me through the process of using Linkedin? Maybe for one of your typical professional task.\n\nStakeholder: Sure. So I think the task would probably be kind of posting, marketing information are posting like a marketing post just for awareness. So let's say, I'm at a conference. And yeah, something interesting is happening. Typically what we'll do is yeah, post something about it. So to do that kind of. I'm gonna walk through this, you know, as I'm looking at it. What I would do is log in. And at the top there's a big button. They make it very easy. You can't miss it. Which says, just start a post. and from there I can choose because I operate the Linkedin for my company, as well as for kind of my special profile. I can toggle between one or both, so if I'm posting as myself. I would choose myself. I can write my post. and they have, you know, a couple of little tools where I can embed, you know. images, videos, or, you know. kind of create a little more pop and circumstance, like nice backgrounds and emojis. And then, when I'm done I can hit this post button, or I can schedule it for later. So there's a nice little clock icon that allows me to say, All right. Actually, you know, most people are going to be logging in, probably tomorrow morning. And so it doesn't really make sense, you know, in the evening, to post it. It's just not going to get as many impressions. So I'm going to be posted at, you know. 9 Am. Tomorrow, when people 1st show up at the office, and I'll get a nice kind of boost in some of the impressions. So once I've posted it, it goes out to the network and it's on the feed, so I'll start to kind of get some interactions. And you know. hopefully, eventually win some business.\n\nInterviewer: Yeah, yeah, you have made it sound so simple. Yeah, so so one major part you have talked about is like to create the professional network. Right? So what steps do you take when you wanted to connect with new professionals on Linkedin.\n\nStakeholder: So I don't often kind of reach out and connect with you know other folks. It's like more. If it's somebody I know, I'll reach out and add them but I don't reach out too much as kind of cold call or cold. Add So in those cases. yeah, maybe I'll search for their name if there's somebody that I'm you know, interested in learning more about. Maybe they're a C, you know, c-suite at a company that we're looking to sell to. I want to get a little background on them, I'll you know, search them in the search function, pull up their profile, kind of take a quick look at their background to see if there's any kind of common threads, and then maybe I'll you know I'll add them.

And when you compare to Linkedin, and what you can use.\n\nStakeholder: I don't really. I think there's kind of a couple of tools that overlap, for example, recruiting like the Laravel community is pretty small. And you know, Lara jobs. If you post something there, you actually get better candidates than you might get from yeah posting something on Linkedin. So in terms of recruiting.

It just kind of clouds your feed, and there's a lot of irrelevant stuff there. So I'd say that would probably be the biggest frustration.

So as an hardcore user of Linkedin, right? So how do you think Linkedin has evolved since you started using it. Any thoughts on that.\n\nStakeholder: Think it hasn't. I mean its core hasn't evolved much for the most part, you know, since it was acquired by Microsoft, it hasn't changed a great deal. It's been, you know, pretty steady and loyal to its, you know, to its following, I think what it's tried to focus on a lot more is, you know, marketing tools so becoming a lot more targeted so that your posts make in front of the right people. So I've kind of watched. Some of those tools, you know. Get a little bit better. They built, you know, there's some new like AI tools to help with developing content for posts. Yeah, that's pretty new and interesting. And then. you know, early on, they didn't necessarily have Linda as kind of the e-learning stuff, but they?

So if you ever given a chance to add or modify something about Linkedin, do you have any anything to add specifically.\n\nStakeholder: Pretty cool. I don't think there's too much off the top of my head.

Or do you use other mediums, or like, what are your thoughts about using email for activities other than professional activities as well.\n\nStakeholder: Yeah, so for personal purpose, I use it. For booking. I let's say, dentist or clinic or booking the appointment. And also, I use email to get the information from merchandise, like, if they have sales or discounts, I'll get it from an email yeah, and also rare. But I also use email to contact with my friends. Got it.\n\nInterviewer: Makes sense perfect. So I have an understanding of the purposes for which we use an email client. And you know. Why, you would want to use an email client? I'm not gonna ask you a few questions like about how you use an E email client. So what are like the typical steps that you take each day when using an email client like, what's a typical workflow like like.\n\nStakeholder: What do you mean? What's the typical flow? I'm sorry.

So the actions that you would take this would be something like I I don't want to lead you to the answer, but To give an example like it could be something like you know, opening the browser.\n\nStakeholder: Yeah, yeah, gotcha, gotcha. Yeah. So I think a typical flow that I use email is that, I open the browser. I get it into Gmail. And then I look at those mails that I haven't read, and I take a quick glance on every mail, and if that's something I think is important. I will 1st market. and then, if those are like trash or spam, I will just delete it. and then I will. Read those emails that that is important.

Your daily daily procedures and actions. how do you go about organizing? Your emails are there like specific steps that you follow to make sure that your inbox is manageable. How does that look like.\n\nStakeholder: Yes, So the tips I follow myself to make sure that my inbox is manageable is by as I, as I said, I would delete those mails that are not that important to make it more clear, and also even for the the important males. But if the conversation has reached to the end. I also did it. And also, I use it. I, I do this by have separate emails. So for some emails, it's really important like, I use it for recruiting.

What are steps that you take when composing a new email or responding to an existing one? Are there specific features that help you? In the process.\n\nStakeholder: Yes. So what did I usually do to write an email or respond to an email is that I would usually use AI assistant tool. Not necessarily in build assistant tool. So I would 1st list my main point.

So I use so many other social networking platforms because, each platform caters to like a specific need of mine.

For Snapchat. It's very easy for me to connect to stay connected to my friends in real time. So Snapchat basically allows you to like, take pictures and just send it instantaneously to your friends. They are just view one's photos photos or videos. So right now, like, I'm in us. But my friends back in India they they still know, like what I ate yesterday for my dinner, because I just send them that picture through Snapchat. Oh. next is Reddit. So Reddit is really good because it helps me keep my anonymity intact, and I can almost always like find different kind of questions or different kind of issues that I'm stuck in, like, let's say. I'm trying to figure out like one particular recipe. But I'm not sure where to find a particular item in the city. I can just like Google it in like a subreddit. So on Reddit. There are like these subreddits which basically cater to one particular interest groups. And I can join those interest groups and ask like, maybe a question, or maybe help other people.

It's also a very convenient way to track history. because once a pull request is made, it is it's not deleted.

If I elaborate on that, it's essentially running, it compiles your code that you, your repository code and you can configure a Yaml file to run that code, run test cases on the Github environment on their server space. The issue I have with this feature is their documentation overall is a little broad. or it's it's very. It's very difficult to find.

So something you did mention was, it has a very desirable ui, the user interface. And I was just wondering, Could you describe the user interface to me when you opened up the application? What do you see.\n\nStakeholder: Of course. I when I search Netflix when I type Netflix in the browser I get presented with its home screen, which has a big banner of some of the shows that it's suggesting to me this banner can be an static image. This can be a live animation, a clip from the show or the movie. and it shows with a title along with a little description about the movie or the show and a play button and a more info button. If I don't want to watch that show or movie. I have options at the top given by Netflix that help me filter out based on home TV shows, movies. new and popular. And my list, which is basically the movies or shows I have planned to watch later on in the day later on, at any time when I feel like basically the show that I didn't get time to watch right now. it also offers a search bar which helps me navigate through any of the specific movie titles or specific shows that I wanna watch. you know, for me the option to change my profile or change the user or sign out from the application next to it. Below the main banner. They mostly show me the recommendation that they have. But even before that they show me the con continue watching for my Carousal. Basically, that carousal is a collection of all the TV shows or the movies that I was watching in the past usage of the app. But I didn't get time to complete. So this is a very helpful feature that I like about Netflix is that right where I left off they I'm able to get back into it in like a very short amount of time in a very convenient manner. So, for example, if I was watching breaking bad yesterday. I can just simply go to the breaking bads icon. It will expand a bit, and it will show me the option to start playing. to add it to my my list, to remove from my list. and to like or double like this also, it will show me how much of the episode I have already completed, and at what timestamp I am at. so it becomes very convenient to know what? At what point? I'm jumping into the series. And yeah, so it basically shows me array of all the movies or TV show that I was watching in the past instances of using the app. But I didn't get time to complete, and it helps me choose. If I want to continue watching the those cities or shows below them, there is a bunch of genres that they offer me based on my personalized content. I think they show me Bollywood.

So if I click on the more info the expand, the basically the modal to become a bread picker. and inside the modal at the very end. They have the they have a section called more like this. So what section basically basically shows us. it shows the shows that are like similar to the show that I was currently watching. So. And it's a lesson that I would like to watch these shows as well. so I guess that is where Netflix shines like it is able to correctly identify what shows are in line with the similar show that I want to watch.

So what Netflix can actually do is they can probably send me. They can start recommending me the videos that I wanna watch that are in my list start recommending me like one month before they get removed. That these shows might not be available on Netflix.

What are some possible positive features or enhancements that you think Netflix Netflix can make, and if so like, how do you envision them? How do you envision interact, interacting with them?\n\nStakeholder: Yeah, sure. Sure. I feel like one thing that they can really pick up from maybe pick up, pick up an idea from Youtube, maybe is like, I, I'm sometimes undecisive, undecisive of what I want to watch. So what I do is I go to Youtube. I just type, the show that I want to watch. For example, let's say, if I want to watch office. So I go to the Youtube, I go to Youtube. And I watch like 2 or 3\u00c2\u00a0min clips of the office on Youtube. And I decide if I'm in the back. So Netflix itself can start offering me a recommendation carousel, which only has like which only has a selective clip of a show that is only 2, 3\u00c2\u00a0min long, so that if I want to try a new show, I can like straight away, go to those clips and decide if that suits me like those clips can have a diverse range of genres. For example, they can be funny clips. They can be suspenseful or cliffhanger clips. Yeah.

No, that's actually that's very interesting. That's very, very interesting. And in, if let's say, that feature was to be embedded into Netflix. how much valuation would do you think, Netflix, it would add to Netflix? Would it really bring you solely towards Netflix and away from other similar web? App web applications.\n\nStakeholder: For sure, I think, that would help bridge the friction between Netflix and Youtube. Definitely. Because, like, I said, sometimes I'm indecisive. And I just want to have a preview of the show but I'm not able to do that on Netflix itself. So I have to go to another app. This might also cause churning towards some users like they don't even like watch on Netflix anymore.

So When, whenever I'm using this app, you get the option of read later, where, whenever you are interested in a certain news, you and but you don't have to time to take a deeper dive. Edit. You can mark as read later, and then you can mark as unread. So so the the reason for that is basically there is a refresh button, or there is a mark as read button on top of the web app which once you click, you will swapping a new batch of news. and you get to view different articles that are published by other medias.

I can totally relate to those interests. That's cool. so I guess before we dive in a little bit could you summarize the functions and capabilities of the system that you're aware of.\n\nStakeholder: Sure. So When, whenever I'm using this app, you get the option of read later, where, whenever you are interested in a certain news, you and but you don't have to time to take a deeper dive. Edit. You can mark as read later, and then you can mark as unread. So so the the reason for that is basically there is a refresh button, or there is a mark as read button on top of the web app which once you click, you will swapping a new batch of news. and you get to view different articles that are published by other medias. And if you want to, keep certain news. And then in your current, you know, explore category.

So every time when I open a platform I'll wait for news to load, and once I and then it, because it's a fairly minimalism app. I would just start scrolling down from the top.

It's probably a news that that was happened that happened overnight, and it might be a oversea news or so that the impact of such news might not might not have taken effect in the stock market, for, say, per se So that's 1 of the 1st thing that I would do. And then. now, you know, after viewing on different categories or the the current news that are being that are currently being feed in. This tab, then I will. There is a mark as read, button on an on a way on the bottom of the web app, and then once I click it. it will refresh, and load me another new batch of news. and then I will continue doing, con continue repeating the same process. And then maybe this time I will see an an article article that I I believe that's worth diving into so this time I will hover. I will hover over that news and then click the read later, button. and then I will keep scrolling down. Keep scrolling down, and then I will have another remark as read button, and that's probably in the last time I'm going to click it for today, at least for this morning. and then once I'm loaded by with 3rd batch of news, and then I will keep browsing through, and then once I'm I hit to once I get to the bottom of the web app I that to that point I will call you a day, and finish reading and closing the app. at least for this current usage of the web app.\n", "goals": ["Grasp as many articles as possible within a short period of time.", "Piece information together to understand global events.", "Identify recent news that may impact the stock market.", "Explore different news categories.", "Mark news articles as read to refresh and load new content.", "Save interesting articles to read later."], "phrases": [{"goal": "Grasp as many articles as possible within a short period of time.", "phrases": ["read as much content and grasp as many articles as I can within a short period of time"]}, {"goal": "Piece information together to understand global events.", "phrases": ["piece everything together and make certain logic behind what is exactly is going on around the world"]}, {"goal": "Identify recent news that may impact the stock market.", "phrases": ["I know.

That's actually a great question. The reason behind that is sometimes because due to the nature of the recommendation algorithm for this app. let's say there is a news that you are not interested in but however, it was published by another media right? And then, once you get a new batch of recommended news. then, the news that you weren't interested in might showed up again. But this time it's published by another media right? So there isn't really a way to get around that. But you kind of sort of main mental memo that I don't want to read anything related to that. That's why I sometime, when you see those kind of news. You just zoom past it, and the quickest way to identify it. Is buying the image of that news. And if you see a repeated image. Then you probably you know. 80 to 90%.

So next to each article there is a you know. a media that published this article, and then there is a timeline right next to it, and then if you hover over your mouse over the let's say it shows 6\u00c2\u00a0h. and then if you hover over your mouse over in the 6\u00c2\u00a0h.

And the publish time is the original published time of that particular media, and then the receive time is, when does that article gets fetched into feedly app itself? And it gives me a notion that let's say the stock market in Japan. Dropped significantly, and the article was published 3\u00c2\u00a0h ago. When I woke up around 7 am in the morning. Right? So that according to that, timeline, I know. Whatever happened in Japan. Sorry whatever happened in Japanese stock market has not taken an effect in the Us.

So if is that, okay, I will start the question. Okay, first, st I want to know, like, what is your primary goal when using the application.\n\nStakeholder: So I daily use social network web application for like news browsing. And sometimes I search for job posting information. And yeah, I just do general scrolling for daily information from them.\n\nInterviewer: So daily information. And for the information browsing, why do you think Cisco is important to you?\n\nStakeholder: so, firstly, I I don't. I do not want to miss out any important information like if there are any great events going on internationally.

So for for the 1st one is When I enter the main page of social application. They would just show a bunch of postings to me, and I can just scroll up and down to to try to locate my intended postings. And the second one is that for for the social application they will have a like a daily rank of which news is like the hardest on that day.

Do you think you use most frequently.\n\nStakeholder: I think it's the I don't know if I don't know if scrolling count as a feature, but I can think about another feature which is search feature because for applications, they have a search bar on the top, and I can just click the search bar and type in whatever I want to search. and they will give me the results.\n", "goals": ["Enable users to browse information by scrolling through postings.", "Provide users with a daily ranking of trending news.", "Allow users to search for specific information using a search feature."], "phrases": [{"goal": "Enable users to browse information by scrolling through postings.", "phrases": ["They would just show a bunch of postings to me, and I can just scroll up and down.", "I don't know if I don't know if scrolling count as a feature."]}, {"goal": "Provide users with a daily ranking of trending news.", "phrases": ["they will have a like a daily rank of which news is like the hardest on that day.", "I can go into the ranking of the news and select the specific news I want."]}, {"goal": "Allow users to search for specific information using a search feature.", "phrases": ["another feature which is search feature.", "applications, they have a search bar on the top, and I can just click the search bar and type in whatever I want to search."]}]}, {"excerpt": "Interviewer: Okay?

Oh, like what difference you think it should provide compared to the general news in news browsing, or the information browsing like, is there any difference between your user experience?

So I'll answer the when 1st there's no predefined time where I log in and browser edit the why will tie into more how I use it. So I use it for a multitude of things.

So I browse my city's subreddit with keyword. Halloween, search to get information about that. So sometimes I just want to like scroll through topics. I follow like subreddits that I follow. So I log in just to kill some time following the subredd itself. So that's why I use it. So the when really ties into whenever I'm free, or whenever I need some information. Also. it could also be like, I also use Reddit as an alternative for stack overflow. So there are a lot of subreddits that are give like technical help or like code queries.

So a Google search basically aggregates a lot of generalized search results. So let's pick an example where you know, I'm trying to integrate a new workout into my routine. So I really want to know how that workout has impacted other people, and how what kind of what kind of results they've seen from it. So instead of googling something like that, I'd go into Reddit and say that. So the reason for using it is that I get personal experiences over facts, and these personal experiences are mostly legitimate. So they and they're very contextual.

First, st open Reddit.\n\nStakeholder: Okay. So again, there are 2 main flows that I go through. So one is, if I open Reddit and I want to like, search for something specific. Then I open it through Google. So I Google, the question. And then I put Reddit after that. So it gives me all the relevant posts. So I just open the post directly and then I interact with the post was the other way. Is I open@it.com. I don't use the mobile app I think the mobile app design is really clunky, and there are a lot of 3rd party apps that are much better than that. But coming back to the point, so if I open Reddit through reddit.com, and the 1st thing you see, is the homepage. So the homepage is like a top bar where you have a search bar on top. You have messaging, you have. You can create a post. You have your notifications. All those are on top, and the top bar then below that the screen is divided into 3 parts, the left most is all your recently visited tabs you recently visited subreddits and the subreddits that you follow. The middle is kind of like a newsfeed with posts from subreddits that I follow, and on the right it's like posts you might be interested in. So it suggests posts that I might like. So I when I come on Reddit, I normally, if I have a targeted problem, then I go through the Google Link. If I don't. If I log in through reddit.com.

So what specific outcomes are you trying to achieve like when you, when you use it? Are there any particular goals, or like just trying to say informed, or like joining a discussion.\n\nStakeholder: I would say, very rarely is there? So if there is an outcome that I'm trying to achieve while using it, it is either very specifically defined before I log in, or there is no particular outcome. So if I want to elaborate on that, there's either a problem that I'm searching for an answer for, and the outcome of that interaction that that. I mean the pro. The outcome of that usage of Reddit will result in the problem being solved. if I'm just browsing Reddit, just to look through my interesting subreddits, then there is no particular outcome.

Are there like any specific people, moderators, communities? Are there any communities specifically that you're part of.\n\nStakeholder: Okay. So people, I don't think Reddit is a kind of platform where you interact with different people. So there are some communities where you can interact with people like. I'm not sure which ones. But there are some conversation subreddits where you can talk to people on live chat. But the point of Reddit is. I. I think, the USP. Of Reddit is anonymity, so it's really hard to trace a post back to the person, because none of their information is publicly visible except for the username which they can. which they can like, modify to not represent their real name. So I usually interact with posts, I would say, and communities and post within communities. not specific users or moderators, I mean, moderators interact with your post. So I don't post a lot. So I would say, I interact mostly with posts within communities. And to answer the second part of your question like, what communities. Am IA part of like? It's a it's a very wide variety of communities. So like, when I was applying to grad school, I was part of like grad admissions. I was part of a study abroad committee study abroad.

I've always interacted with like Cs career questions that subreddit lately I've been interacting on the university's subreddit. Also a lot because there are a lot of posts that people make like even a couple of days ago during fall break there were a lot of people reaching out to make plans to like, go around the city and like go to the museum and stuff like that.

So I normally interact with all the posts that come on my feed.\n\nInterviewer: Makes sense. So just coming to the the processes. Stuff of things. So how do you like? Could you walk me through the steps you take when you want to post something or like comment on a specific credit post.\n\nStakeholder: Got it so I would say I've never posted something on reddit like in like. So I see credit posts. Can be classified into 2 tests. One of them is like posts asking for advice or asking for solutions, and the second is like posts about your experience about something which others can draw insights from. So most of the posts that I've done are posts asking for advice. I'd say I've asked for a lot of questions in like Cs career questions and grad school admissions where? It's helpful to ask for advice. So going through like specifically how I post when I log in to reddit.com I go. So I previously mentioned that there's a top bar of notifications create and like messaging and all that. So you can just click on create post. You. The 1st thing you have to choose is a community that you want to post in. So if suppose. I am. okay, let's let's just actually go to one of the communities. I am a part of which is let's say. let's just say the university's subreddit. So I have to select that I want to post something in the university's subreddit. Then I can add a title to my post, I can add a body to my post. This body is like a markdown editor, so you can use like a skip sequences, and you can have headings, and like h. 1 to H. 4, you can have paragraph lines. You can have everything you have in Markdown. You can also add images. You can add video, you can add links. You can add polls. basically many ways to interact using a post. So once you're done with all that, you can add tags to your post, so some subreddits make it mandatory to add tags. So I like suppose I'm posting on a like a vet subreddit like asking questions about. If you have animals at home like you have to tag the post with what kind of animal you have so vets? Who are on that subreddit will kind of filter out. So if there, if like, there are only doctors for dogs, they'll filter out only the dog posts, and they'll only interact with those posts. So that's where tags are useful. So yeah, so that's mostly my process or anyone's process that they go through to create a post commenting is pretty simple, like, you just go to any post that you want to interact with. You press on comment, and you can either create a new comment, or you can reply to a thread of comments so that that thread is like you can. There are like different stacks of comments under each other. So any thread you go to you can reply under that.

Stuff of things. So how do you like? Could you walk me through the steps you take when you want to post something or like comment on a specific credit post.\n\nStakeholder: Got it so I would say I've never posted something on reddit like in like. So I see credit posts. Can be classified into 2 tests. One of them is like posts asking for advice or asking for solutions, and the second is like posts about your experience about something which others can draw insights from. So most of the posts that I've done are posts asking for advice. I'd say I've asked for a lot of questions in like Cs career questions and grad school admissions where? It's helpful to ask for advice. So going through like specifically how I post when I log in to reddit.com I go. So I previously mentioned that there's a top bar of notifications create and like messaging and all that. So you can just click on create post. You. The 1st thing you have to choose is a community that you want to post in. So if suppose. I am. okay, let's let's just actually go to one of the communities. I am a part of which is let's say. let's just say the university's subreddit. So I have to select that I want to post something in the university's subreddit. Then I can add a title to my post, I can add a body to my post. This body is like a markdown editor, so you can use like a skip sequences, and you can have headings, and like h. 1 to H. 4, you can have paragraph lines. You can have everything you have in Markdown. You can also add images. You can add video, you can add links. You can add polls. basically many ways to interact using a post. So once you're done with all that, you can add tags to your post, so some subreddits make it mandatory to add tags. So I like suppose I'm posting on a like a vet subreddit like asking questions about. If you have animals at home like you have to tag the post with what kind of animal you have so vets? Who are on that subreddit will kind of filter out. So if there, if like, there are only doctors for dogs, they'll filter out only the dog posts, and they'll only interact with those posts. So that's where tags are useful. So yeah, so that's mostly my process or anyone's process that they go through to create a post commenting is pretty simple, like, you just go to any post that you want to interact with. You press on comment, and you can either create a new comment, or you can reply to a thread of comments so that that thread is like you can. There are like different stacks of comments under each other. So any thread you go to you can reply under that. So that's mainly the 2 ways that I create post and make comments.\n\nInterviewer: Right. And just coming to the earlier point, you said that there are like only 2 types of questions, or like posts on Reddit. Like, you know. So are there anything other than those 2 that you can think of like entertainment or just like news posts that you can think of that. You have interacted on the site.\n\nStakeholder: Yeah, for sure, like, there are a lot of entertainment posts like, like anyone can post about anything. Right? So I'd say entertainment is subjective, but it also it always comes down to those 2 posts where either you're posting something for others to draw insights from, or others to draw conclusions from. Or it's just putting information out there. It can be anything. It can be like your experience using using a new phone, or you are writing a new story about some after who like recently passed away, or something like that. The common trend in those posts is you sharing information that others can absorb. So it all ties down to passive posts, whereas active posts are. You're asking people for advice straight up. So like, Hey, I am facing this problem with my code. Can you please help me? So people will comment on that. So I think there are different genres, of course. Sure, like there are entertainment, and there's news and all. But again, it just boils down to whether are you sharing information, or are you looking for interaction to gain insights from them. So yeah. and boils down to 2 posts.\n", "goals": ["Create posts that belong to a specific community.", "Add a title, body, images, videos, links, polls, and tags to posts.", "Use markdown editor features like headings and paragraph lines in posts.", "Tag posts to categorize them for specific audience interaction.", "Filter posts using tags to find relevant content.", "Comment on posts by creating a new comment or replying to a thread of comments.", "Distinguish between passive posts for sharing information and active posts seeking advice."], "phrases": [{"goal": "Create posts that belong to a specific community.", "phrases": ["The 1st thing you have to choose is a community that you want to post in.", "I have to select that I want to post something in the university's subreddit."]}, {"goal": "Add a title, body, images, videos, links, polls, and tags to posts.", "phrases": ["Then I can add a title to my post, I can add a body to my post.", "You can also add images.

If I am, then I don't have a time preference. It's I'm I'm on the app whenever I want to. If I'm not, then it's usually when I have like some downtime like maybe when I'm eating lunch, or if I'm on the bus, or something like that, where I don't have anything to do, I might just open reddit and scroll to see something interesting. So that is my, that's the time I use reddit Also the time duration for which I use it varies so sometimes you could be using it for one question, and that one question could lead to like many other questions. So before you know it, you spent like 2\u00c2\u00a0h on it, like just like going down some rabbit hole.

What challenges or frustrations do you encounter on Reddit like? Are there any barriers that you think of that can stop you from doing what you want to do on the platform.\n\nStakeholder: I would say, on the desktop desktop platform. No. but on the mobile platform there are quite a few barriers. So the for one. The mobile platform is quite slow and clunky, like the Ui. Is not very intuitive. I'm not sure how they like. I'm not sure if it's different on other phones. But I use an android phone and it's very unintuitive and very heavyweight. So if I want to give you some examples like when you're creating a post, and you leave it in the middle. you can't save it as a draft which you can do on desktop. So that is something that is frustrating. If I want to post on Mobile Another thing is. you cannot keep track of comments intuitively on Mobile, so on desktop. You have like threads where you can easily see, but on Mobile you have. You also have threads, but I feel that the desktop version is much more clearly put out. So I would say, user experience ui ux is one frustration that I have on the mobile app.\n", "goals": ["Enhance the user interface and user experience to be intuitive and lightweight on mobile devices.", "Enable saving a draft of a post on mobile devices.", "Improve the ease of tracking comments on mobile devices."], "phrases": [{"goal": "Enhance the user interface and user experience to be intuitive and lightweight on mobile devices.", "phrases": ["the mobile platform is quite slow and clunky, like the Ui.

Do you encounter low quality or misleading posts?\n\nStakeholder: Yeah, so there are. So there are some subreddits which are very well moderated. So you have a lot of bots like auto moderators. So they fact check your posts, and they alert the human moderators if they feel that a post is not correctly, not entirely factual. so if if a community doesn't have auto moderators, it definitely like for a community community to exist, it has to have a moderator. And that moderator keeps track of any low quality or low effort posts. So I feel that if a community has a strong, a strong set of moderators, then the posts themselves are reliable. of course, anything you find on the Internet is not 100% reliable.

And coming to some scenarios like, do you use Reddit to stay updated on current events and trends? And if so, like, what? What subreddit should we follow for this.\n\nStakeholder: Yeah. So I do use reddit to stay updated on trends. So like, there's 1 subreddit just called news, which is just international news. There are also subreddits for like specific country news. I follow India news. But I don't really like, I don't really interact with any posts on India. News I just occasionally see it from time to time. But that being said, like Reddit, is not my primary source of news. I have other apps that I use to do that. there could I could use like subreddits of popular news channels. I am pretty sure they? They might also be posting on Reddit. But I just find it more convenient to keep news out of Reddit, because it's more of a it's more to satisfy curiosity, and not for news. no, no, not really for news. So news. I don't follow on on Reddit. That much current events. Yes, that also is very genre, specific. So if there is a current event that is related to a subreddit that you follow, then you will come across it. But other than that, unless it's something like Nobel Prize or some worldwide event like the Olympics, I'm pretty sure you won't hear of it on Reddit unless you're previously searching for it. Like if we, if it's a worldwide event, then there are some posts that will show up in like popular like there is a popular page that Reddit has where it. It shows you most of the posts that people are interacting with. So if there's something as big as Olympics or a Nobel Prize. It will show up there.

And has it ever influenced your purchasing decision.\n\nStakeholder: Yeah, yeah, I. So I use reddit. I use reddit all the time, for. So I have a laptop that I bought in February this year, which I researched a lot on Reddit. So the one thing that I like about Reddit is that if you go on Amazon, there are mostly good reviews about something Reddit is more of a balanced perspective, and you can also find people from varied backgrounds talking about the product. So say that I was trying to buy a laptop and someone who's into video editing has their opinion on the laptop and so if I was buying the laptop for video editing, I'd have a very.

There's a subreddit called, ask doctors. so you can post for you can post like any questions any health related questions on that subreddit and, like healthcare professionals will answer you.

I would say so if I was trying to incorporate like a new let's say I was trying to like, do Yoga? Or something like that? So that comes on the health right?

It will still allow you to open the app. It'll still allow you to view posts like view comments, view pictures on the app I'm sorry. Not on the app, but on your feed. But it won't allow you to make new posts, nor will it refresh the feed so you can use it offline. But I'd say, after you exhaust like, after you're done using that part of it like, after you're done interacting with all the posts, you can't really use it further. Yeah.

So are you aware of any customization that Reddit offers like for feed or notification. And and how has these changes enhanced your experience? If you have used them.\n\nStakeholder: Yeah. So for feed, you have a lot of view options. So under the the top bar that I was telling you there is like a filter option where? So there's a filter option. And there's a view option. So the filter option basically, you can sort posts by new by top by trending, rising. So there are a lot of different criteria where you can sort the posts. Also you can.

So the feed also can be customized by like post view. So you can have like card view or compact view. So card view is like I I would say. It's kind of like Instagram where one post at a time comes on your screen like like not exactly one post, but not more than 2 posts at once. And you can keep scrolling down like that versus the compact view where there are like 7 to 8 posts on your screen at once, and the post body is quite small, so you have to click on each post to read it. So I'd say that. It depends on what you're using it for. So again, when I said that, I'm just using it as a passive activity, I prefer, like card mode where I can just scroll through posts.

And how do advertisements on Reddit affect your experience? Are they intrusive? Are they helpful? What do you think.\n\nStakeholder: Okay? So I'd say the advertisements. They are like, they run Google ads, so it it's kind of related to, I mean, any website that runs ads will have the same ads, I think, targeted ads towards you. So the experience doesn't really get ruined because of ad, because it's very subtle. To be honest, I am using an ad block on my browser. So maybe that's why I don't see any ads. But I'm still pretty certain that the the even before I used ad blocks ad block. The ads are quite subtle like, it doesn't interfere with your post experience or your reading experience. But when you're on the home screen, yes, do you do see ads? But they're always in one location, so you don't accidentally click on them. And you kind of learn to work your way around the ad. Also, there are not many ads on the screen. There's only one at any given time, so I feel it doesn't ruin the experience.

And would you ever consider buying the premium edit.\n\nStakeholder: Yeah, actually, I would like I I don't see the like. I I would actually buy it. I I'm not sure why I haven't bought it yet, but maybe sometime soon I might get the premium tier, but the only advantage of the premium tier, I'd say, like from my usage point of view, the only advantage is no ads, and since I already have ad block it kind of like, since I already have ad block.

What do you think of its like design and layout? And are there any specific features or elements that, like help or hinder your experience.\n\nStakeholder: Okay. So the layout, like the layout, as I explained, like, there's a top bar. There are 3 distinct sections, but I think one of the customizable features that you can do is you can do it on light mode, dark mode. So those kind of features are available. You also have, like a legacy Reddit. Where there are no animations, there are no rounded corners for columns. There are no like separating lines between posts, nothing of that sort. So it's it's a very fast website the legacy reddit. But from a user experience point of view, I think the current Reddit is better.

How do you manage notifications? And are it, are there any specific ones that you find useful, or like unnecessary. Maybe.\n\nStakeholder: Yeah, so you can have you can have, like post notifications, comment notifications, upload notifications like metal notifications. You can have as many notifications as you want, but I I don't get notifications because it's running on browser, on the browser. You can only get notifications if Reddit is open.

You can search for food it'll cover all kinds of food, but there are separated for. say, vegetarian dishes, or there are subreddits for something as vague as tomato based dishes or something like that, so you can post on food.

If you're generally so I would, I would segment this into 2 parts. So basically coinbase at that point of time, I think, was focusing only on us customers, because I am not completely sure this is an assumption I'm making, because at that point of time Coinbase was the primary choice people used to look for in the Us. To do A to perform a cryptocurrency trade. and I had actually got the recommendation for coinbase from a Youtube channel owned by a person in the Us. And they had showed me some features on the video which I wasn't able to see in the app that I had downloaded in India. So I figured they are doing something, especially for the Us. People which I am not able to access. So I I think if you are talking about the Indian market at that point of time, if Coinbase would have, you know, gotten deeper into the regulations that are present for. or cryptocurrency exchanges in India. it would have been helpful for tapping into the Indian market. They, if they had a seamless interface to integrate our bank accounts with coinbase at that point of time, or even some kind of a payment interface to get my cryptocurrencies into cash or cash to cryptocurrency conversions, because that is one thing I was not able to do. I was not able to get my cash from my bank to oh. a coin that I wanted to invest in. I wasn't able to do that at at the 1st place in Coinbase. So yeah.\n\nInterviewer: Okay, thank you. That was very helpful. So for the next part, I know you said that right now you can't do stock trading since you're in the United States.

I think. If you're generally so I would, I would segment this into 2 parts. So basically coinbase at that point of time, I think, was focusing only on us customers, because I am not completely sure this is an assumption I'm making, because at that point of time Coinbase was the primary choice people used to look for in the Us. To do A to perform a cryptocurrency trade. and I had actually got the recommendation for coinbase from a Youtube channel owned by a person in the Us. And they had showed me some features on the video which I wasn't able to see in the app that I had downloaded in India. So I figured they are doing something, especially for the Us.

Or are you more focused on stock trades.\n\nStakeholder: Okay, that's a good question. so initially, it was mostly stock trading. I so and in the beginning, when I just when I just started this out I was just playing around with this stuff. I was not making very heavy investments. It was just like it investments of a few \u00e2\u201a\u00b91,000 2, 2, 3,000 at Max. And I was just trying to look at a look and feel of how this works. and what kind of things propagate profits, what kind of things propagate loss? What are the different kinds of things I can do here? I was just trying to play around with them. I did that for about a month, and then after that, I started seriously trading and when I say trading, I mean long term investments, mostly not intraday trading So I used to. Every day I I used to keep a track of whatever I have invested whatever, how the market has moved. I used to keep a track of which particular stocks are performing well, which which of them are not performing good. And then based on that, I used to take decisions on a monthly basis, or like a fortnightly basis to realign. Where do I want to invest. So that is how I used to do my trading. But that was my pattern of trading back in India. Oh. later, at a point of time, I also started doing cryptocurrency trades. I have been averse to doing cryptocurrency trades compared to stock stock trades, because. 1st of all, the market is very, very volatile for cryptocurrencies, then. Stocks, Indian stocks, Indian equity. and sometimes there are scam coins that just come up in cryptocurrency. So I I was a very averse person from that kind of an aspect also. but I did used to invest in blue chip coins that you you can call them blue chip coins, the ones that are very popular, like bitcoin, ethereum, polygon, and stuff. So I did use to continually invest in them, because they are relatively safe investments. And yeah, but the amount of investment that I did in stock was definitely much, much higher than the amount of investments that I did in cryptocurrencies. So, yeah.\n\nInterviewer: Understood.

Thank you so much for elaborating you mentioned that you make a decision at the end of the month. Based on how the market has been. So could you walk me through? How that decision making process goes through generally.\n\nStakeholder: Okay, so yeah, so there are a couple of factors that I like, look out for when I'm making a decision. 1st of all. what kind of an investment have I made? So there are. There can be. There is a 1 kind of segmentation called a small cap, mid cap and large cap, stocks. Small cap. Stocks are generally those which which which are available to you, you can. You can invest in them, but they are smaller companies per se. They, these companies. a less number of people have invested in them. If this company does good, then you can get a large amount of profits, but if it does bad, all of your profits can go away, so there is a high risk attached to them. Then there are mid cap stocks in which the amount of risk that you are taking is a little less. There are a little larger number of people that have invested in this, so your risk is shared and they are. The the stock is a little more liquid by liquid. What I mean is, you can sell it, or you can buy it easily, much easier than a small cap stock. and then there are large cap stocks which in which they are generally very safe to invest in. They are, mostly. They mostly have a result of an in profit. Increased profit for you. So keeping the these things in mind, I see how they have performed in the past 3 months. How has their performance been so? If it, if it is a small cap stock, and in the past 3 months. If they have not performed well, even if they have gone a bit down, I would still be fine with it, because I am taking a risk here, and if I have a positive outlook for this particular stock, saying that even if it is down right now, I feel that it is down because people have not seen the potential in it, and they will see the potential in the next few months or so. I would keep a bet on it. but for a large cap stock, if I try to see like how they have done it. and if they have not really performed well in the past 6 months. It is an indicator that a lot of people who have invested there are pulling out. And that shows that maybe some of these people have some insights into into the company that I don't have, because there are. There are so many people investing into it. So it at this point of time I would be inclined to get my stocks out of here. So that that is one kind of decision, then another kind of decision that I take is based on profits. So if I feel that I have maximized the amount of profit that I have to take from this particular transaction or trade, I would buy out my profits and sell the stock. And yeah, that would be another kind of decision that I would take. So, yeah, these are the different kinds of decisions.\n\nInterviewer: Understood that was really comprehensive. Thank you so much. That helped me understand a lot as well. No. So what do you think are your main goals when you use these apps.

So an ideal experience generally involves having a seamless integration with the bank account initially, because I think in my experience, that has been the deciding factor of using or not using an app because some of them have very easy processes to integrate your bank account into their application, in which you can just in which they just verify whether, you. What you're saying is correct, and they integrate the account with your bank account, and you are able to make exchanges. And then if once you are able to do that I think I am.

It's like once in 2 weeks, or something. So for stock exchanges it is once a day, because every day at the end of the day I would just check. What has the day been like? Has there been any changes? How have the changes been? And yeah, so that that is once a day, and once in 2 weeks or so I will open it for some time to refactor my investments. As I said before I try to. I try to look what decisions I have to make and try to refactor. Where do I need to sell? Where do I need to buy more and stuff that that I do once in 2 weeks or once in a month. Okay, this is how how it happens. and for yeah, and for crypto. It is once in 2 weeks, because the market is just so volatile I can't keep up with whatever is happening. So I just put in, and I trust it to work. It's magic. and if it doesn't, it doesn't I? Just I I go in with the feeling that I this all of the money that I put in can just disappear.

So the 1st question is in your experience. You know what are the typical reasons you. you know, find yourself in a situation where you're supposed to find a house.\n\nStakeholder: So you're asking about which situations I am using such apps, in which situations.\n\nInterviewer: No, just the fact that, like, you know, why would you typically find a house?

One of the ways is when I check these types of websites that show houses and apartments available.

What kind of information do you have to usually put into this form and like, what are the steps, or what is the experience that you go through when you're filling out this form.\n\nStakeholder: Yeah, the form. Actually, it requires something like the 1st name, the last name, the email, the mobile number, the move end date, the number of beds required, the number of baths required, and the custom message. And actually, this is confusing, because when you're searching for a house, you're not necessarily having all these informations, like. Sometimes you're flexible. You just want to communicate, to know more or to get specific information. Sometimes you don't want to write a custom message. You just want to pick the available option you like. And sometimes you don't want to share much information like email, phone, 1st name, last name, and all of them are required fields, and you still don't know a lot about the one who is providing this house, so it doesn't feel very comfortable to give all this information and to specify exactly how many beds you want, how many baths you want and write a custom message.

You can just specify the option you because there are limited options in housing, you're not customizing something that doesn't exist. So if there is like 3 apartments.

I think like giving the information could be after confirming the availability from the 2 parties like if they said, this apartment is available, and I said, I'm interested.

You can also use the drawing functionality I've talked about earlier after that. After you specify, like the location, you will have several filters. You can filter by price range. you can filter by the number of beds and baths you can also filter by the home type whether you want a house, an apartment. and also you can filter by extra criteria, like the move-in date, or any other things that you want, like allowing pets, for example, having utilities, and so on.

So I think, probably moving on to the whole. The the search and the filter step that you talked about right Could you just sort of briefly describe the different steps when you're doing a search and a filter thing? What are the different steps that you take on that particular in that in that particular process.\n\nStakeholder: So usually the search allows you to write like something about the location that you want, and then when it zooms into the location that you want. You can also use the drawing functionality I've talked about earlier after that. After you specify, like the location, you will have several filters. You can filter by price range. you can filter by the number of beds and baths you can also filter by the home type whether you want a house, an apartment. and also you can filter by extra criteria, like the move-in date, or any other things that you want, like allowing pets, for example, having utilities, and so on.

Or do you think something is missing, or something that you would want to change? To make it a bit easier for you, or something that you really wanted.

They don't enforce you to enter everything, because sometimes you're not very assured about what do you want so? And but sometimes filters make me confused that what if some of the house providers didn't enter all the information? What if I filter by some criteria, and then I lost all the options where the owners didn't specify. For example, maybe the owner can allow pets, but he didn't try that explicitly in the profile. So when I just filtered by allowing a pet, they will just show for me the ones that has confirmed. So maybe I would love if there is an option where I can have like. I can also allow the people who didn't specify, so I can see both with with like.

For example, the dropdown has it has like a name like it has a label for pet policy. It's a drop down where I can select, for example, dog, friendly cat, friendly and like that, maybe if there is like a check box called include, for example, like the options that didn't determine, or something like that.

So maybe if the website has some sort of rules that enforces people who own these properties to take the picture in a specific format, for example, on, for example, sunlight using like specific angles.

So essentially, most of the things are like. They go from cakes to dresses to drawers, you know you can. And the list continues. So I try to spot like you know, accounts that I've mostly like cakes, because I know my girlfriend likes like eating cakes a lot. So I try to go. And then, you know, get like really good cakes. And and I and I order from there. But that's really been the main main way in which I purchase stuff on Instagram, because then I would go and see the the contact of the shop, and then I would use that now to reach out to them, either like to a landline or or, you know, using Whatsapp in. In other cases, I've used Whatsapp. Maybe if I if I'm looking to maybe purchase address. I would I could go to an account of a vendor who, you know, is who is showcasing this plot, and, you know, see the designs they have in store. and and I'll go to an actual market and ask for those. These designs I would have seen like online. So those have been the 2 primary use cases of of me using like, Instagram, yeah.\n\nInterviewer: Awesome.

There is this thing where you know, if you have a shop, you can actually more or less have it as a business account on Instagram, where you post like the products you make. So essentially, most of the things are like. They go from cakes to dresses to drawers, you know you can. And the list continues. So I try to spot like you know, accounts that I've mostly like cakes, because I know my girlfriend likes like eating cakes a lot. So I try to go. And then, you know, get like really good cakes. And and I and I order from there. But that's really been the main main way in which I purchase stuff on Instagram, because then I would go and see the the contact of the shop, and then I would use that now to reach out to them, either like to a landline or or, you know, using Whatsapp in. In other cases, I've used Whatsapp. Maybe if I if I'm looking to maybe purchase address. I would I could go to an account of a vendor who, you know, is who is showcasing this plot, and, you know, see the designs they have in store. and and I'll go to an actual market and ask for those. These designs I would have seen like online. So those have been the 2 primary use cases of of me using like, Instagram, yeah.\n\nInterviewer: Awesome. So from my understanding, it sounds like you generally have a purpose in mind when you open up Instagram. you're looking for a specific gift. Is there a way to easily find a specific gift? Is there some type of feature that facilitates that for you.\n\nStakeholder: Yeah, I see. I think there is a there's this search bar on. So when you once you open is the Instagram especially the Instagram web on the left panel. You have, you know, like your profile, you have, like a lot of other things there. But then, when you go on the top right, you have a part where you can do like a search, and there you can now enter the name of of what you want to look for. So in my case, I would be like cakes. and it's really good, because what happens is, I don't know if this is a feature that is really integrated in the system is it will search for like cake vendors in the area you are in right. So like right now, I'm sure if I went to search for cakes in the Us. I would see like people who are doing cakes like just around me. So I found that really useful. and if I don't see immediately what I'm looking for, I'll just add maybe the name of the location. Maybe cakes in Rwanda or cake sellers in wonder. Or you know those those kind of terms, and and it can easily pull that kind of information. for me. Yeah.\n\nInterviewer: Awesome. So it sounds like when you perform a search.

What I mean is, if you, if if let's say I was to use Amazon because I've used Amazon sometimes as well, but not as often as Instagram. you you just go and see the product you swipe your card and you purchase, and it gets delivered to you. Now with this one, even though you've seen the product. What happens is you need to still get in touch with the vendor right? to get the the product sent to you. So I think that that use case. I'm sure it's definitely good that way, especially like my side of the world where in in some cases people.

I wanted to buy, you know, but it it appears that this Instagram account was actually a malicious account.

So the time I opened the app, and one of the things that I did not feel to mention is one of the things I do not like with Instagram is for me to use the application right I have to sign in. so I would have loved to use the application without signing in right, but I but each time I have to use it I have to sign it. and that takes time. and some. Sometimes I don't want someone to know online. I just want to go and search for what I'm searching for. I get it. And I'm and I'm out of it right? So we that is one thing I don't like. Okay. But now, moving forward. let's say I have signed in. I've gone to the search bar, and I've searched for you know the vendor I want to get the kicks from. Oh, flowers form I I would automatically. It's gonna save my search results right in a dropdown. So if I come back to Instagram, maybe after one month it will show me the vendor I, you know, searched for like one month prior right, which is also a good feature, because then I don't have to. Always, you know, search for vendors. I can just pick one I used in the past. Now the next thing I go and I go to their page, their page would have their bio, and you would have a section where you have highlights. Maybe they were. They are posting about you know, events they have created with their products and things like that. And then there's a part where you have, like a gallery of of those images. The good with the gallery is that when you go to the gallery you have people commenting, and you also have likes. This is a really good feature. Because if you see engagement, then you'd actually know that actually, people are using this site. People love their products, and and people would would like to recommend people to use it as well. That that was, that was, I think, an important feature. I that helped me to spot that you know. The the other account I I just mentioned to you was a malicious account. because you expect that if an account, you know, has been there for a long time, and they have, let's say, a list of a thousand products, then the products right at the bottom should have more likes. you know. But then, if you are seeing just one like and maybe 0 comments, then it just means that this person came one day and then uploaded all the images and left right for someone to fall on them.

And let's say, after this call, I really really you know, enjoyed our conversation, which I do, by the way, and I would like to connect more with you and I, and I think I would love to know you more, and maybe as a friend, you know I would, and you are on Instagram. I would go to follow you on Instagram. What what that does with me is, if any time in in this life. I lose your phone number or your immediate contact or your email address. We are still friends on Instagram, so I could always lodge back there and get to you. So that to me is a is a really good benefit for me, because I've traveled across like You know different countries now, and I keep changing my phone numbers. So so if if I if we were friends and you're we are friends on Instagram, I can always, you know, reconnect with you by getting in touch with you, using using the application. So to me, I find that component really helpful as well to connect with people here.\n\nInterviewer: I see. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Thank you for that.

So what I mean by this is. if let's say you're someone who tends to more or less like follow the trend. What happens is you always want to catch up with where everyone is and what they are up to, and what they are doing, what they are buying into, and you know, and what they are doing with their lives at this point in time, and and that takes a lot of time, because you might see one picture that might, you know, say, you should look at another picture, and maybe look at an event and look at another thing.

So what happens is. if if I follow you. you can follow me back, and we become friends now for people like let's say. if I were to follow someone like Barack Obama he might not know that I'm following him, because his account might be a a celebrity account or a star account, so to to say.

I'm irrelevant, or my content is irrelevant to him, because he will never show up in his feed. Right? That that is, one that that is one thing, the other. The other aspect is. you could also more or less follow like groups or hashtags. and that also every content that anyone posts there you would also be able to see it, you know. So those are the various ways in which you can follow people. You can follow groups, and you can follow like star people like people who have made a name of themselves, but then you're following them makes you irrelevant again, because they will never see anything about you.

I know I used to be in groups when I used Facebook. But it's been a really long time ago groups on Instagram I haven't used, but I know their hashtags whereby if you subscribe to a hashtag which is more or less like a group. What happens is, if anybody ever posts anything on Instagram, and you know, calls that hashtag, or just, you know, puts that hashtag on the post. It's gonna show up on your in your feed, right?

Just leave myself to be, you know. locked in. and once that period, you know, elapses. I can. And I've I've gotten what I want. I can log out from it. you know. So it's it's it's how I try to manage the use of the application. so so to speak. Yeah.\n\nInterviewer: If I understand correctly. there are 2 aspects to that. One.

So for me, actually. it's not that I choose Instagram. I think in some ways. what happened was when I because I've traveled a lot. I've moved from Cameroon to Ghana and to Germany, to Rwanda. Now I'm in the Us. For example, what ends up happening is when you go to a new place. You don't really know, like the vendors there, you don't know what they have to offer. and so an app like Instagram, with these accounts on them. would quickly, you know, help you to see where vendors are, cause their bios. You also have their location. which number to call which products they have. That is very, very helpful information. And for someone like me, who is probably in a place for a very short time, right? And and I think that is how useful, I would say Instagram has has been for me in terms of purchasing stuff. But but apart from that I I would not really say I choose it like over something else. It's just out of convenience that I I use it. Yeah.\n\nInterviewer: I see. and so when you do purchase something, it sounds like you agree for it to be delivered. Somehow.

So what I do is, once I see your bio information, I get your phone number. Once I get your phone number, what I do is I would go to. I would either go to Whatsapp or, you know, direct, call you. And I would say, I saw this product and this product can I know the cost of it? And that is also something I feel like they should put on the website on. I'm sorry on the pages, the business. What you put there is. They don't put the price of the products. They just show you what the products are. But I I would imagine that if they did that, then maybe people would not ask about the products, and so they will not get the feedback they need on pricing. And so once I find out, figure out the price of the product. I would go ahead to ask for the phone number I can use for the payment. And I once I conduct that payment. I would confirm my address where the whatever I'm buying, you know, should be delivered to. And then I basically just wait. Once the product comes, or is it or is about to be dispatched? They'll give me a phone call. Tell me, you know they are about to reach my my home, or they are at my home. I should come pick it up so. That is generally how I think, ordering and delivering and pickup works. Yeah.\n\nInterviewer: Awesome. Thank you so much for that. Maybe. I can kind of go over real quickly. Some of the things that I've been able to glean from this great conversation with having. So it sounds like you travel around a lot.

Please feel free to ask questions or add comments at any time, relax. We are just having a casual conversation. First, let's talk about the general usage of slack. To just start by introducing how you currently use Slack?\n\nStakeholder: Yes, sure.

So let's move on to the next question. What is the main purpose of using slack for you? How do these purpose help you achieve your specific goals?\n\nStakeholder: So I prefer using slack because it's instant communication with anyone I wish to talk to within the university. An advantage I feel within slack that you don't have in other applications is I don't need to like save anybody's information. I don't need to like, save their numbers, save their email.

So besides communicating with some anyone in the university instantly, I also like the channel feature within slack, where I can reach a wide audience immediately. That would you know if I was doing that over email or something, it would take me more time. Another thing that I like about the channel feature is that when I join a channel, I have the history of that channel at my fingertips, like so I have access to information that was there before I even joined the channel, and I felt that was a pretty good advantage over other apps and so and at any given point, it's good to know what people are talking about, what everyone's sharing, be it with respect to a particular subject, or could just be in general, like the MSC channel for software engineering, I like to hear what's happening around within the department, within the program, what's happening around campus.

So on top of the screen, there is a search feature that I would use to I would enter keywords to look, to look for something specific. So if you know, for example, business and marketing strategies was a subject I had last semester, last mini semester. So I would search for something that the professor said, using the keyword over there, and it would display a list of you know matches a problem that I encountered is again, coming back to the slack, showing me everything from a channel that you know before I even joined. So because there's so much information out there, sometimes when I search for a keyword or keywords, I get way too much information in the search results.

So what makes you that wanted to start practicing coding questions.\n\nStakeholder: Okay, so my background in coding. I 1st learned how to code since grade 10.

So if you have a good contact score, it really helps for university applications.

I practice daily if if I really want to practice, and I feel that and I will practice daily if I know that an interview is coming is coming up. So that's That's more effective this way. Because after you practice right before the interview, your your brain is more functioning and you can prepare better, and I find that if you have. if you you want to practice for that day you need to like allocate a good chunk of the time for you to sit down and go through the practice go through the problems like more patiently. And if you really like. You can't do this without patience. So you really need time within a day, so that you focus on on practicing questions, and you do. You cannot have like distraction. So usually, I just allocate like a big chunk of time for a day. Yeah.\n\nInterviewer: Oh, okay, so how much time do you usually spend on each coding question?\n\nStakeholder: Okay. So this this question is really depend on difficulty. So and it really depends on experience. For example, if I just a if I? If I just a new person using using this platform to practice coding questions. I might take like 20\u00c2\u00a0min to 30\u00c2\u00a0min for an easy question and 30\u00c2\u00a0min to an hour for a medium question. But after like, I practice for a long time for easy questions depending on the questions. I can just finish it in 5 to 10\u00c2\u00a0min for medium questions. depending on the question type. For example, I'm really good at arrays and trees. And for those questions I can finish like in 10 to 20\u00c2\u00a0min. But for hard questions again, it really depends on question type. If it's about some if it's a Dfs question or a priority queue question. or a Dp question, I I can do this depending on the question. I can do this from 30\u00c2\u00a0min to an hour, but I cannot guarantee that I can solve. I can solve this question like the most often way, and to pass all the test cases. But for other other type of questions, for example, monotonic, monotonic stack and some other algorithms that I'm not really familiar with it. then I cannot solve it. Basically like, no matter how much time I spend, like, I usually spend an hour. And then to conclude that no, I cannot do this on my own. So I will go look at the solutions and the solutions will typically help me to get understanding of how this question is supposed to be solved, and look at this like, and also take like an hour to really comprehend the solution, and try yourself. And even though, after you look at the solutions and practice the question, it's also really important to go back to this question some other time to make sure that you don't forget.

Yeah.\n\nInterviewer: Hmm, yeah. So I think you mentioned on like for each coding question there. It depends like the time it it depends on the difficulty. So I just wanna clarify. I think you mentioned easy, medium and hard. So those are the metric that you use, or you like use to determine like, how long you should take like, how how long is it gonna for you to spend on the the question? So so it's like 3 level like there's no other level than that.\n\nStakeholder: Correct so like, those levels are not created by me. They are created by the platform. So they are created by the leetcode and leetcode will categorize, like each question into a easy medium or hard, and I usually use them to to know that if I want to practice them. For example, I usually practice medium hard questions and target like within, like 20 to 40\u00c2\u00a0min. But if I just want. If I see this question and see that, see that it is an easy question I would just allocate like, for example, like 10\u00c2\u00a0min to solve this question so like it does give me like a rough time on how much time I should spend on it. And if I spend more time than then, like this recommended time. Then I will. I will just try to practice more on this category of questions, so I can do better next time. And but this, like the difficulty level set by equal, it's not. It's not 100% correct. Some medium questions actually take long, like a longer time than harder questions depending on the edge cases. So some medium questions you have to really think through, like all the edge cases and add lots of if else. And that's sometimes it's more time consuming than hard questions. So it's like the like, the time is not really fixed. It's not 100% fixed to the difficulty. Yeah.

And then right after I click submit, I find that I miss an else statement. And I I just spend like in a 1 second to to write the out statement. If I click submit right after that the platform doesn't allow me to do that, because it says like, you are submitting things too quickly, and you just. And you need to wait for a while to submit again. So I think that's really annoying for me. So that's really slows me down. And also I find that something that's also disturbing is that after I submit my code, I find that the performance is not always correct. For example, I tried to submit the same code I coded like 2 years ago, and then the performance, like degraded for some reason. But the code is exactly the same. So so that is also really disturbing.

So I can like literally see my improvements over time, and it also have a feature to to track all the questions I did, and how many questions I did so after like seeing me doing like I have, like 200 questions done like it really gives me confidence.

I think it's about 3\u00c2\u00a0Hours? don't know might be a day. But anyways. yeah, there are other people who are also contesting by running the weekly contest.

I don't really like to use chat gpt, because when you are halfway done the project can be really complicated.

Yeah.\n\nInterviewer: Thank you. Would you describe the steps that you take when you go about using chat Gpt, to complete your tasks?\n\nStakeholder: Okay? Sure. So first, st when I before I use chat, Gpt, I have some questions in mind. So when I I usually use the website online. I do not use the application regularly. So I will open their website, and then I will try to organize my language to make chat, gpt, understand what I'm saying, to understand. Like make, chat, gpt, understand my my context, and If chatgpt, misunderstand any of my message it can be it can provide me with. The answer. I'm not really expected. So after I after I have my questions I will click the send button and send my questions to chat, Gpt. and then Chatgpt will give me back its answer, and sometimes I will also attach some images and also some documents to chat. Gpt, so it's like, it's better illustration of my questions. So if I I'm only doing like plain text. Sometimes it's hard to explain everything, so sometimes I will use images and documents to help Chatgpt understand my questions better.\n", "goals": ["Generate ideas at the beginning of a project.", "Create an outline of important points before starting the project.", "Refine ideas before starting a project.", "Organize language to ensure clear communication.", "Provide additional context through images or documents for clarification."], "phrases": [{"goal": "Generate ideas at the beginning of a project.", "phrases": ["when I want to start a project Chat Gpt can provide me with some ideas", "at the beginning, it can provide me with some ideas"]}, {"goal": "Create an outline of important points before starting the project.", "phrases": ["if I tell, Chat, gpt what what I'm planning to do often it can give me an outline about what you should do.

I think, before they chat, Gpt was down for for a while, and people some people like rely on it to submit their work like, or to like trying to do something in a timely manner.

So when I send them messages I can tell them that I was also like a student in my university, and to increase the possibility that they want to refer me for the position.\n\nInterviewer: And why do you decide to follow these steps?\n\nStakeholder: So let me just go answer this question in 2 parts. So the 1st part is like, when I'm looking. applying for a certain position, like, for example, like the A role at company, then only company employee is able to refer me. So that's the reason for me to add the company name to the to the when I was doing the searching and the reason for me to add my university to the search. keywords is that, I think?

Sure. So I mean, of course, like the main reason I use the app is to do sell payments to like a few of my friends. Basically split split costs and all of that.

So that's normally what I use the app itself for. right. But apart from that. there are obviously many services like payments like. So I use apple pay, and then using that any like target or something. So any grocery stores, or like any outlets. So I use apple pay there. So which directly connects to chase itself.

It is perfect the way it is.\n\nStakeholder: Honestly. It's perfect the way it is. I think it handles everything that an a banking application should handle, and I don't think there's an instance where, let's say, I've used. I've used multiple banks like back in India and in the States. But I don't think there are like. I don't think there are any features that are like different. Obviously there might be some con country specific features, but I'm not including that in this, because it doesn't obviously matter in this context. So I would. Yeah, so I would.

What are your thoughts on the security that the website, or like the chase, digital like digital infrastructure provides like, do you feel that your money is secure with the with chase?\n\nStakeholder: Right. So Chase is obviously like a very well known bank. So although, might not have like a very good idea of how well, they've implemented like the security infrastructure, but as much as long as I've used it. I would say it's really secure, because, like, while I was signing in. or the on the web app, like I put in my username and password. But it was the 1st time I was signing in on my laptop. So it. They had this whole 2 factor thing authentication thing set up like from the get go. So that was good. So that way. That's like an additional layer of security. And I believe, like my funds are pretty safe with the bank. because, like every time I do a transaction. I get a notification on my phone saying that this much amount of money has been spent, and then I can also contest it, which is great.

And I was going to follow up with the question regarding 2 factor authentication. But you already confirmed that they made you go through it. So that's good. Yeah. So would you? Would you say like, you, you would also want to use their website to provide you any insights into your financials. I mean, you told me that they are giving you a breakdown of your funds in different accounts. But would you say, like, you would also want the website to sort of give you any data analysis into where you are spending the money like, be it food like all these different expense categories, does Chase provide that? And if not, would that be a feature? You would like to have.\n\nStakeholder: Right. So they do give me a good way of checking all the transactions I made. although I'm not really sure if they let's say, track, what kind of expenses I do. So so they have this, as I mentioned before, they have this plan and track feature where it basically keeps track of how much money I'm spending every month and how much money I'm actually getting, let's say, through income or some other means. So it lets me set a goal and then tells me how much exactly I'm supposed to be earning, and are spending every month to make sure I hit that goal by a specified timeframe which is good, because, like obviously helps me keep on track and not really spend a lot so.

Would you say like, you, you would also want to use their website to provide you any insights into your financials. I mean, you told me that they are giving you a breakdown of your funds in different accounts. But would you say, like, you would also want the website to sort of give you any data analysis into where you are spending the money like, be it food like all these different expense categories, does Chase provide that? And if not, would that be a feature? You would like to have.\n\nStakeholder: Right. So they do give me a good way of checking all the transactions I made. although I'm not really sure if they let's say, track, what kind of expenses I do. So so they have this, as I mentioned before, they have this plan and track feature where it basically keeps track of how much money I'm spending every month and how much money I'm actually getting, let's say, through income or some other means. So it lets me set a goal and then tells me how much exactly I'm supposed to be earning, and are spending every month to make sure I hit that goal by a specified timeframe which is good, because, like obviously helps me keep on track and not really spend a lot so.

Yes, I can. I can do that. So I'm on the main web app, and then on top. We have like these these like columns and like tabs, which are basically for like pay and transfer, plan and track, and all of that. And as I scroll down, there's another section, for see all transactions. it gives me like a small like, I think, the previous 5 transactions. It shows me the previous 5 transactions, and then it gives me the option to see. Also, I'll just probably click that and then go with that. Yeah. So it shows me my current balance. It shows me my account and routing number if I click on another button. Right? And then yeah. So it, as I, as I mentioned before it shows me my balance. It shows me the deposits have done this month, and then all the withdrawals right? So as I scroll down I just see what how much is spent, and where. and at what time? And what is the balance at that point in time? Right? But apart from that, I don't really see it categorizing the thing except that it just categorizes how I spend it. Like it says, if it's card Zelle or yeah, if it's like another fee or something like that, or if it's like an account transfer.

So I can click on my chase checking account which is connected to my debit. Right? So it provides me like this debit card coverage so if I click on that so let me set it.

So the only option I'm getting there is my savings account, because I don't think I've added another account to send to this. So there is a link to an external account. So I'll go. I'll come back to that. There's also transfer activity and external accounts. So I believe external accounts is to basically track fair, like basically to add accounts from for other people, right? So looks like I don't have chase accounts, but I'll see if I can sell. I don't think Zelle is I don't think we can sell on of the web app. so I will. Yeah.

I mean, if you don't know someone's account number, would you mind just going into that, at least into that process. And we will just stop where you have to input the details. There we that you already have it. But yeah, let's just go up up until there.\n\nStakeholder: Of course. Yeah, I can. So what I can do is I can just transfer it to my savings account itself. That will. I mean, let's assume that once you add an external account, that it will show up the same way as savings accounts does. So so let's go back to schedule transfer in schedule transfer. There is a option for transfer from, so I will choose my checking account and transfer to. I will choose my settings account right? So then it tells me how much amount I'm supposed how much amount I I wanna transfer. So let's say, I put $1 right. And it says, transfer date. So I'm assuming that's the date I want to schedule the transfer, for I'll keep it for today itself, so that, you know it gets done quickly. And there's also notice self. So just to keep note of what this transfer exactly is, for there's also an option for setup, repeated transfers. That's that I'm assuming is for like stuff like rent or utilities. I'll just see what that does. So if I turn it on. it lets me select the frequency tells, lets me select. When do I have to send it in that one? So if I select monthly, then it lets me select what date I want to send it on. But if I if I select, let's say weekly, then it lets me select what day I want to send it on what like? What day of the week I want to send it.

So yeah. So once I've entered all the details. I can just click on next date. So then it tells me it asks me if everything looks okay. So just to confirm which is a great detail. so it tells me that the amount I'm sending is one. The transfer date is 31st of October, which is the 30th of October. I'm sorry now and then. Notice, self is none right? So alright. So basically, once I click transfer money, it should be that. Yeah. So it's scheduled to transfer of one dollars to my savings account now. I believe, due to banking hours. It it'll send it on 31st of October. So. Yeah, so, but it has been scheduled.

So yeah. So once I've entered all the details. I can just click on next date. So then it tells me it asks me if everything looks okay. So just to confirm which is a great detail. so it tells me that the amount I'm sending is one. The transfer date is 31st of October, which is the 30th of October. I'm sorry now and then. Notice, self is none right? So alright. So basically, once I click transfer money, it should be that. Yeah. So it's scheduled to transfer of one dollars to my savings account now. I believe, due to banking hours. It it'll send it on 31st of October. So. Yeah, so, but it has been scheduled. And then once I go to transfer activity. it'll basically show me that it has been scheduled.\n\nInterviewer: Hmm, okay. Got it? How? How do you feel? How? How? How would you say?

It'll just be more convenient, so that I don't have to like reach. Reach my phone every time. But yeah, apart from that, if you really don't want, if you just wanna do an account transfer. Then it's great, because, like, it's super intuitive, and then it makes sure that you don't send the wrong amount, or like to the wrong person. So that is great, and then it lets you schedule properly. It also lets you repeat the transactions is a great, so you don't have to come and keep on doing it again and again. Yeah. My only my only concern is that it does not have cell. So, except that I think it's really good. And it, though it's super seamless. And it's great.

You know, podcast is one thing that even people with special needs can listen to so improving accessibility features in our platform is of utmost importance to us.

Actually, one of them is, you know, developing an AI recommendation engine. So we basically understand the themes and the memories of the users. To you know, get a hold of their histories and what they like listening to. So this helps us in delivering personalized content. And you know, also allowing users to input their interest openly by frequently giving them feedback forms to fill to tailor their experience.

And you know, within the podcast itself, like, we'll have a share button or a rate button, for example.

So we really don't wanna constrict our platform by having just a limited number of creators which people just watch them. And basically them having a monopoly over our platform. So last month itself we bought over 2,000 new creators on our platform, offering them great deals which other platforms would not offer them so this is one thing, and another thing like I mentioned previously was, you know, sort of enhancing a recommendation in such a way recommendation system in such a way that people don't just get what they ask for. They also get something more unique. So let's say, for example, you know. Let's say me. For example, I love watching conspiracy theory documentaries. So what spotify also offered me. As a matter of fact, yesterday was. you know, breaking down one of the movies which was related to conspiracy theory. So this in turn, basically led me down another rabbit hole of starting to watch a movie related podcasts and opening up that door for me, which was in in my definitely something that I really enjoyed. And yeah, by offering users open ended questions every now and then, and giving them something refreshing to watch is. you know how we try and avoid saturation.\n", "goals": ["Allow users to share or rate podcasts to inform others about their feelings on the content.", "Enable users to create playlists that can be liked and saved by others.", "Bring communities together around specific topics through playlists.", "Create themed groups and forums for users to connect over shared interests.", "Host live podcast sessions and Q&A sessions with creators.", "Collaborate with a wide variety of creators to avoid content monopoly and offer diverse content.", "Enhance the recommendation system to suggest both requested and unique new content.", "Offer users open-ended questions and refreshing content to prevent content saturation."], "phrases": [{"goal": "Allow users to share or rate podcasts to inform others about their feelings on the content.", "phrases": ["we'll have a share button or a rate button", "this kind of tells users who are currently looking at that podcast about how others feel about it"]}, {"goal": "Enable users to create playlists that can be liked and saved by others.", "phrases": ["anyone and everyone can create their own playlists", "people can like and even save that playlist"]}, {"goal": "Bring communities together around specific topics through playlists.", "phrases": ["a particular playlist can have, you know, let's say, a, podcast that talks about geopolitics", "helps try and bring communities together, communities of users"]}, {"goal": "Create themed groups and forums for users to connect over shared interests.", "phrases": ["we also try and create a theme based groups and forums"]}, {"goal": "Host live podcast sessions and Q&A sessions with creators.", "phrases": ["offering live podcast sessions and QA, with creators"]}, {"goal": "Collaborate with a wide variety of creators to avoid content monopoly and offer diverse content.", "phrases": ["collaboration with the creators comes in", "don't wanna constrict our platform by having just a limited number of creators", "last month itself we bought over 2,000 new creators on our platform"]}, {"goal": "Enhance the recommendation system to suggest both requested and unique new content.", "phrases": ["enhancing a recommendation in such a way recommendation system", "people don't just get what they ask for", "They also get something more unique"]}, {"goal": "Offer users open-ended questions and refreshing content to prevent content saturation.", "phrases": ["by offering users open ended questions every now and then", "giving them something refreshing to watch", "how we try and avoid saturation"]}]}, {"excerpt": "Interviewer: I see. So I, I can see that you are pretty dynamic in that area then so yeah, like, now, now I'll ask about, like some challenges which you face. So how do you generally address the challenge of content, saturation on the platform to ensure that users can easily discover new podcast like, I'm pretty sure you have a a lot of new like lot of users who post content regularly.

So like like so pretty sure there would be some like situation where monetization goals like conflict conflict with the in content integrity, like, just as you said that you have a like, you have to manage the saturation level. So how do you handle the content? Integrity basically.\n\nStakeholder: Oh, yeah, yeah, for sure. I think this would be prevalent in any company in this day and age. So yeah, so what we try and focus on is not pushing, you know, too many ads and essentially disrupting the users listening experience. So we place ads usually just at the start or just at the end of podcasts. And so let's say, I, wanna place 4 ads, I won't place them. You know, in between the podcast I'll put 2 of them 2 30 seconds at at the start of the podcast and 2 30 seconds at at the end of the podcast this just ensures a positive user experience, you know. So yeah. And another thing that we try and focus on is giving. You know, people don't like seeing ads. But what you know, what's the best way around it? What's the worst evil? It is basically targeting the advertising, you know, giving the users something that might be useful to them at 1 point or another. And we also are very transparent with our users about.

One of the features that you know, I wish we did sooner was bringing on people from multiple ethnic backgrounds.

We really don't wanna process such huge amounts of data that it kind of ruins the user experience because of the low, latent high latency and the low loading times due to the you know the computationally expensive resources that it takes. And you know, we also one thing that was a technical limitation on our side was not enabling the accessibility stuff which I mentioned earlier, so supporting multiple languages, allowing the users to navigate, spotify via voice or via their keyboards. So this is one thing that we really avoided and have recently started implementing.

Great question. So yeah. Yeah. As a matter of fact, let's get a bit technical with this. So we previously had a common sort of back end infrastructure for our you know, for our web based desktop app and our phone. And you know, this idea, this wasn't really ideal for us, since. You know, the phone has only so much of memory and RAM at 1 point of time compared to a chunky laptop. So we had to sort of branch out and keep the 2 entities separate the mobile sort of code base and our web Ui code base. So at the end of the day, our objective is to optimize our algorithms, such that you know, basically, we don't want to sacrifice our functionality and get more efficient day by day. And we also offer a very regular rollouts, if you've noticed. So over the course of 2 months, we, you know, have some or the other update where we implement a new feature. For example, last month. We just came out with this sleep timer thing. So a lot of people listening to listen to podcasts just before sleeping. So they can set up a timer of about 10 to 15\u00c2\u00a0min before listening before starting, the podcast and the podcast would just stop at the 15th minute So we got a pretty good user feedback from that. And you know, we invest a lot on our infrastructure. And our software and data science teams, we regularly hire them from top colleges and ensure that our developers are also happy and content at the end of the day.

So one kind of ui, you exchange, you can say, is, we are trying to minimize our click so for example, to reach to a podcast earlier, a person had to click a search button. There wasn't a search bar to begin with. So the search button then led to opening the search bar where the user would type. Now, we've just integrated the search bar directly in our ux, which, looks a whole lot cleaner. And also the sharing options is something that I've discussed. That we've really improved upon. So you know, users can directly just send Instagram or Whatsapp messages onto their respective groups about whatever they like. and it appropriately, cap captures. The Pictorial represents representation as well of the particular of the particular podcast that they're listening to you know this in terms, basically at the end of the day. You know, these small small user experiences at the end of the day. Just make them happy and be on our platform. so yeah, we have also been you know, playing around a lot with the aim lately. So we give users, these sort of daily mixes which are kind of podcast that are new to them and that we think that they like listening to. And yeah, in short, just making the Ui whole lot smoother with lesser clicks. And just improving the accessibility aspect of it as well like voice commands are a big thing now and navigating around with the keyboard and stuff like that.

So like, how does the spotify podcast features and features like. who do you mainly target for the podcast features. And how do you? How do their needs differ from the music? Only listeners. So quick, you know, overview of that.\n\nStakeholder: Okay, okay, great. So the thing is, we, we can be a whole lot risky with the music. The people who listen to music. We can just you know, give them so, for example, a person listening to pop there is. You know, you really can't say whether they would like metal or not, so we just throw it out there and kind of you know, that helps us track whether throwing this random genre of music out there helps them. or rather gives us details to whether this sort of unique genre is something that they would like or not. Now, this kind of thing we can't really do in the podcast space like let's say a guy. You know, let's say, it's a a person who likes listening to spiritual podcasts. We can't just all of a sudden just throw in a regular day, in a life of a Youtube vlogger podcast that just wouldn't work. So we have to be a whole lot subtler with it, I think. Kind of give them more avenues like I said previously to explore, but that the ones that do not deviate too much. And you know all this is handled using our machine learning algorithms.

So do you think you can walk through? the application for me? Assuming that you want to book flights for this future trip that you just talked about.\n\nStakeholder: Sure. So generally my process starts with an aggregator. I generally have 3 to 4 aggregators that I take a look at. I start off with using skyscanner. I put in a few of the like. I generally do country to country pairs, or like a relative area of the destination to the relative area of sorry relative area of the origin to the relative area of the destination. So like nearby airports, potential dates. So I try to mix it up with all sorts of options. and if I'm finding something that I'm liking, I might search for that in more detail. Let's say I'm liking a certain city pair, or I'm liking a specific date. Then I might search for options around that I look around the timings that are available. how that would factor it into whether I have to book a hotel. How does that connect with other modes of transport? So let's say I'm flying into a city, but then I have to travel to a different city by like a train, or something like that which is pretty common for me back home in India. So I try to plan out my travel, such that things fall into place, and I don't end up having to stay in a city for like 20\u00c2\u00a0h doing nothing. So my 1st priority starts with getting the price down, getting the city pairs slash country pairs down. Then I move on to the dates. and finally onto like time and overall logistics. That's that's the way I do it. Once I have a set of flights like in mind that are my ideal options. Then, depending on how expensive they are, I might check out other aggregators like Google flights, Kayak. There are bunches of them. That you can take a look at if it's not that expensive, then I'll just go through one of the platforms that are part of like skyscanner so bunch of different travel companies partner with skyscanner and have their prices come through. And I'll look at my ideal flights. I'll go to the actual providers website. I'll check out how much it costs me. I'll check out what sort of coupon options I have upgrade options I have. I'll just make sure all the terminal, all the logistics. Information is correct. I also sometimes check out providers directly without going through an aggregator. Sometimes you can get a better discount that way. So there's a lot of research that goes into it before I finally make the decision to book a flight. It's a pretty involved process. I end up taking, like at least an hour or so, just to scar out different options, combinations to find. What's the you know? Potential best option for booking. Once I've finalized on an itinerary and on a provider. I just fill out my information. If they need my passport details, my date of birth. My legal name and other details fill out the declaration forms. And I just pay the amount through my credit card website.

That's that's the way I do it. Once I have a set of flights like in mind that are my ideal options. Then, depending on how expensive they are, I might check out other aggregators like Google flights, Kayak. There are bunches of them. That you can take a look at if it's not that expensive, then I'll just go through one of the platforms that are part of like skyscanner so bunch of different travel companies partner with skyscanner and have their prices come through. And I'll look at my ideal flights. I'll go to the actual providers website. I'll check out how much it costs me. I'll check out what sort of coupon options I have upgrade options I have. I'll just make sure all the terminal, all the logistics. Information is correct. I also sometimes check out providers directly without going through an aggregator. Sometimes you can get a better discount that way. So there's a lot of research that goes into it before I finally make the decision to book a flight. It's a pretty involved process. I end up taking, like at least an hour or so, just to scar out different options, combinations to find. What's the you know? Potential best option for booking. Once I've finalized on an itinerary and on a provider. I just fill out my information. If they need my passport details, my date of birth. My legal name and other details fill out the declaration forms. And I just pay the amount through my credit card website. That's that's generally the flow.\n\nInterviewer: Wow! That's actually super comprehensive. I think a lot of work goes into this process, and you seem to enjoy the process. Am I right.\n\nStakeholder: Yeah, I think there's a definite dopamine hit to like finding a good deal. I really like that. And it's interesting. It's like a process of discovery. So you try out different options to figure out different combinations. And there are obviously different tricks of the trade. So there's like a forum called Flyer. Talk right. There's a lot of different tricks that you end up getting to know about. And you you just try to apply them as as you're doing your own searches. and that's that's how you sort of get ahead of the airlines.

You can book what are called non revenue tickets tickets without actually paying for them. So it's basically like a reward that you get on your credit card. It's a reward for being a customer of that service of that airline and using it frequently. So for those you would need to log into the airline website to check the availability on whatever itinerary that you've decided on.

So now it will show me different options. it shows me I can fly into Hyderabad. I can fly into Mumbai, I can fly into New Delhi, Kochi, Ahmedabad. It gives me all of these different cities to fly to. I can select one of these. Let's say I select Hyderabad now, once I've selected my destination, I can select my origin so I can decide to fly from New York, Washington, DC. Chicago. All sorts of different options are available. Any city I want to fly out from I can choose that so let's say I choose New York. So now it opens up a new tab where my search from New York to Hyderabad is actually existing. This is where we get to like the actual interface of the aggregator. We get a screen with 3 tabs for sorting the best option, the cheapest option, the fastest option. and it lists a bunch of different itineraries in a row by row basis. it tells me. When am I flying from? Where am I flying? To? What time I leave? What time I arrive. The same thing for the return. How much time will it take me to go that way which airline or airlines I'm flying through? That's what it shows me. and on the left I have a bunch of filters for, let's say, stops whether I want to fly direct. One stop 2 stops. What time I want to fly out from between. I can choose specific hours. I can choose. How long can I allow myself to be in flight?

But I could walk through a potential scenario with you. For example, let's say I'll give you a common example that used to happen with me. My university bachelor's university was in Vellor, and the closest airport ended up being Chennai. and to get to my home I ended up flying to Kolkata. so I would end up regularly, flying between Chennai and Kolkata, and the cheapest flight and the most convenient for me usually worked out to be the night flight. and it used to land at around 1020 pm. Now, to get from the airport to the train station where my the last train for the day would be leaving would be at 1145 pm. So I would run into a situation where I only had, like an hour, 20\u00c2\u00a0min gap. From the time I landed to the time I had to make on this make it on the station. So this was a logistical challenge for me, because I knew it was like a 50 50 situation. I knew half the times I'd make it half the times I didn't, which is, which is what actually ended up happening. So it was a risk. If I had a better option available, something that just maybe lands like 1\u00c2\u00a0h earlier, so that I would be able to make sure that I get home that night, and I don't miss my train, and I don't end up having to stay up for like 6, 7\u00c2\u00a0h, waiting for the next train early in the morning. Then I would go for that option. but it again depends on the price differential. If the price. Differential was way too high. Then I just couldn't afford to like, you know. Spend that much extra as a college student for the luxury of potentially not missing my train. as my time was cheaper compared to actual money. so I think priorities change with time. That's that's 1 of the common examples that used to happen to me back during my bachelor's.\n", "goals": ["Ensure that flight schedules align with subsequent transportation options to minimize layover or waiting times.", "Provide alternative travel options that offer convenient arrival times within budget constraints.", "Balance cost with convenience to cater to different financial priorities of users."], "phrases": [{"goal": "Ensure that flight schedules align with subsequent transportation options to minimize layover or waiting times.", "phrases": ["Now, to get from the airport to the train station where my the last train for the day would be leaving would be at 1145 pm.", "This was a logistical challenge for me, because I knew it was like a 50 50 situation.

Do you think there is any way the app could have helped you resolve this.\n\nStakeholder: I don't think this is like more of an app issue. I think this is this is more to do with the airline pricing and getting the timing right. I I mean, there could be better alert options to just let me know when flight prices drop down. But it's very difficult to come up with accurate rules for exactly what you want. because flight prices are very dynamic as well as your life. Situations are also pretty dynamic. I might think that. Oh, I'm going to fly to XYZ. And suddenly, within 2 days I booked my ticket, but my plan completely changes because some something else happened in my life. So it's it's kind of hard for these websites to also sort of predict what I would do, and let me know at an ideal time where maybe the cost is low for the exact itinerary that I want to take. It gets very complicated because the pricing is controlled by the airlines, and the my desire to travel for a specific itinerary can also change pretty rapidly based on situations.

I needed a reminder on a few different routes, just to make sure that if any one of them goes down in price.

Are there any obstacles that you face.\n\nStakeholder: The research aspect is the biggest obstacle, because you want to do around 500 searches at the same time, because you're doing combinations of city pairs, country pairs, dates. travelers, different classes, all sorts of combinations to make sure what's the best. So it just grows exponentially. You want to do hundreds of searches at the same time, but nobody wants to let you do those searches at the same time. So it ends up being a very time intensive thing. and nobody's there to feed you all the different combinations.

So how long do you typically spend on this app?\n\nStakeholder: It is again very situational. If things are working out my way, maybe it will just be 10 to 15\u00c2\u00a0min. If it isn't, it can go up to a couple of hours at the worst. and this can be distributed over several days as well. The like, I said. The search pattern isn't 1 fixed pattern.

So into 49, so 1, 20 into 49 times different classes of service. So sometimes premium economy works out to be cheaper than economy. So 2 classes of service over there. and this thing, but also repeated for the points segment, which works completely differently. So you end up with like a huge amount of searches. So it is 1, 20 into 49 into 2. Let me just calculate what that turns out to be. Yeah.

So how much of this does the app actually allow you to do.\n\nStakeholder: Skyscanner in particular, allows me to search on basis of a country. there are other apps. Every app has its own way of doing things. For example, if I use kayak it allows me to take 3 airports, 3 cities rather than airports, as input, as in the origin and output as in the destination 3 and 3, and it allows me to take a date range of plus minus 3 days on both the sites for the sorry only minus 3 days, my bad not plus. So I can select either today or 3 days before that day. So a total of 4 days in terms of departure, and similarly a total of 4 days when it comes to the return. So that's the combination that kayak does. It makes like a whole matrix for you, where you can see the cheapest option among the entire matrix. So that is one of the more convenient options. Google flights does it differently. It allows you to search everywhere. You can fly from one place to everywhere, and you can give specific months. You can give specific weeks. Oh, I'd like to go on a 2 week vacation. I'd like to go on a 1 week vacation. and I'd like it to be in this month or that month or in that period. so you can specify those constraints as well.

So 1st I open the app. I go to my phone and open it. And I guess if it's music, I just search for the music music that I want to watch, or I click it from like. if it's something I watched like I listened to recently I would. I would just click it on like the menu, because they just it tells it gives you a history of like the most recent stuff you listen to in case you want to start watching, listening to it again. And then, if not, then then I just like load the app up and it just on the front page on your homepage. It has like shorts that you can look at. And it has like longer form videos that it thinks that you'll want, based on what you watched the last time. So I just opened my phone. And yesterday I watched a video on computing Fibonacci numbers really, quickly. It was well, I was on the bike. And now the same channel that has done that which I subscribe to, because I thought it was a good video has recommended me a video on logic puzzles. And so then if I were, if I were like, gonna watch this, instead of being the interview, I'd click on it. And I do want to watch it. I think because I like logic. Puzzles are something that interests me a lot. And he, he, I think, makes good videos. So yeah, I would click that and then, if not, I would scroll down. It looks like it's trying to get me to watch some shorts. So I might watch like a funny little short for like a short time. But I like, if I'm on that. If I'm on Youtube like I'm not gonna want want to watch shorts. I really want to like watch a longer video, probably because I only would get on it when I have a bunch of time that I need to fill. Then I would pick like a longer video out. Usually I aim for either. If I'm I have a certain amount of time left on the bike. Then I would aim for like filling exactly that time, if not like a 10 to 30.

So it seems that Youtube is your favorite platform so well, why is it like? How does it meet your needs? Different from other platforms?\n\nInterviewer: The truth. Truth is, I don't really like stories. Because stories. They're kind of dependent on you watching the previous episode, something like a movie or something like a TV show. They're pretty long, and they require you to like, watch over and over like and pay attention. I'd rather have a bunch of stuff that I can just watch out of order, or watch in whatever order I want, or skip, or whatever that's better for my attention. Span and shorter things. I had this other streaming platform I used for a while called Curiositystream, or Nebula, or something. I actually learned about it through Youtube, and and got into it. But I found that it was a lot weaker because the recommendation algorithm just wasn't as good. So like for someone who wants, like. basically an endless stream of like, really like. heavily, algorithmically curated curated videos Youtube has the quantity of videos that you want. And it has, like the diversity. And it has. You know, I'm I want more short stuff, short form stuff. And that's like what Youtube specializes in like nonfiction stuff. Yeah, it kind of just matches up with what I want to watch a lot of the time, and it's like it's easy for me to find a new thing that I want to watch, because. you know, I've been watching Youtube videos for probably a decade at this point, if not 15 years.

Okay? so that was about like extreme weather conditions. One of scenarios I want to come back to the Daily Use type of questions like So for your day, like every day you've told me that you look at weather and precipitation.

And what influence does that have on your trip, like on the way you prepare for your trip?\n\nStakeholder: Yes, so I think I'll I'll start with the how advance I start looking into it. Usually like you have an idea like you know, couple of weeks before you're going somewhere that you'll be going there. So yeah, I immediately. Once I find that I'll be going. I either check for historical data if it's available somewhere, or I check for future weather focus because it gives you focus. That's you know, I had like monthly forecast as well. So you at least have a good estimate of what the what the weather will be like. and and not just like the temperature and precipitation. As I mentioned earlier, but also like the cloud coverage, like, if you're going for a beach vacation, let's say, and it's going to be super cloudy. Then, you know, you might need to reconsider, because usually people go there to enjoy sun. Right? So yeah, so stuff like that, you'll definitely check if there is some. I don't know if you're going for some astronomical event trip right like, if you're going in a hillside to like absorb some astronomical event. but it's like overshadow or like the there is an overcast like, there are a lot of clouds, basically. So it might have to cancel the trip. So stuff like that, you can at least start seeing a few weeks before, and then, as you approach the date, the weather, like the weather forecast, becomes usually more accurate.

Exactly makes the code space different from the text editor, that you're saying, because you're saying the things that developers can do that text editors can't. So what exactly can those things be.\n\nStakeholder: Okay, yeah. For, for example, we all use like notepad, right? And for notepad, just a a simple, like plain editor to edit, like every every text space file, but when it comes to code space it has to like fit for any kind of language like, for example, if we like code into Java, and and when it comes to Java you may have to like, like customize like in indent distance, or some like highlighting, and and you know that will make you like like or like syntax tracking.

For for example, if you like, if you are doing like, for example, python. And in Python the index actually means the scope or a single piece of code like, for, for example, if gonna write, write a function and you're gonna do an indent like a kind of like space to to tell, to tell the compiler that this piece of code belongs to this function. and that is how indent means to a programming language.

You may, you may say it's a string, it's integer, and and and after it is a like variable names, and the syntax highlighting is you will like separate separate code for different purpose, like like this piece of this piece of string is for declaring the types of variable. And this piece of string are defined the variable names something like that, and like for loop for functions, for something like that it will.

Space.\n\nStakeholder: Yes, actually, I have a preference, and the the most I I use them most frequently. Actually, I I have tried. Like many different ide tools like, for example, I have used sublime. I have used item, I have used Vs code something like that. But why? Why do I choose vein? Actually, the 1st reason is, I think being is cool because you have to like like coding in Terminal, and that makes me feel I'm the kind of hacker or something. and but for more practical reason, is that actually, when the develop developer may have, like many like opportunity. You have to work at different machines. And and actually, each machines, the building tool to to coding is actually beam. There's no Vs code. There's no something like that. There's no other things, and if you get used to like 2 personal tools, you'll you'll be. You'll find it difficult to like to code in in every single machine, and also vim is very like, it's very light, and it opens. You can open like very quick. And it it just works at every like every server. Perfectly. So when I develop something, when I have to like change some things at at the server, I can just easily open the vim and and modify the code, and when, when, if I if I don't get used to the vim, I may find difficulty to easily modify codes on the server. And that actually matters much. Yeah. So so for me, I choose to like in my personal, in my local development environment, I will, I will. I will like customize them to to. I will install a bunch of like cool plugins. I will like, customize the interface to make it. Just look really cool and like like fit to my my personal like experience.

And and when the machine that don't have a a ui don't have a user interface, and you can only access to the machine through terminal and terminal is a a a interface. We had only has the tech space command line. and also the beam is wrong. That that that interface. So so, yeah, so so the Mo.

For, for example, if you, if you need to like, search, search, file, or or open file, or something, you have to, you have to like type in commands in, in a, in a, in a Vin execution line. And actually the Plugin can do like many things, for like, for example, I can, I can install like fuzzy search in in my, in my vein, and when when I use fuzzy search I can like I can. I can bind bind the the open file into some some keyboard shortcut, and and it will like open open a interface that I can type which file. I want to search and let Leverage the fuzzy search to search the file I want. and then I can. And then, using that tool, I can just open each file like very quick, and it will like pop out like like a like a tabs, just like other like normal editors. So I can. I can. I can easily just manage many files in vein, and also for plugins also been also supports like copilot. and I can, I can. I can easily, like, integrate compiler in in my theme. So when I, when I coding it, will like pop out the AI generated code that suggests me to to execute, to to implement.

Like, for, for example, I'm working on quality assurance projects recently for our class and my, my typical workflow is that I will open my terminal and I will open Tmox. Tmox is another like like application in the terminal. You can like open every different windows in your terminal. and I will open. Tmox and I will split the tmox split the window into half, and one is for command line one is for vim. Okay? So okay. So when I I when I want to open the beam, I will. I will 1st go to the Directory where the project is, and I will. I will just open a file, and and the command is very easy, like theme like Project Dot Json something like that. and you can just open the file and after open a file. Every issue I will. I will like open another plugin called file tree. It will. It will just show a a file, a file structure in in a pane of in in your, in your name, and that that looks like the pain, and that that just looks like every like every editor. Yeah. I will. I will open the the file tree and I will the file tree. I can open files in the file tree, and I can also open files using fuzzy search. And I will. I customize my fuzzy search into like simple, like keyboard shortcut like control. P is open the file in this project, and like control, E is select the the file that already be opened by the bin that is called buffer similar to similar to tab in in different editor. Yeah. And like, for example, yeah, control P for open new file to add new files in the vein and control E is to like switching between different buffer and like I will, I will use like backslash P to to do the search across different different files. And I will quickly locate the the target file I want. And yeah, and and after, like I modify the calls I will. I will use in Tmox to switch to another window. That is, the coming line is, and I will execute the code. There, I can. I can just see the result immediately. And there's any like bugs or error. I can just switch back to Vin page. So so yeah, so basically, my workflow everything I can, I, everything I need I can down in the terminal. And I can also store the store. The process of the team up.

So yeah, so actually, I just I, just, I just see so many people's workflow. And and I, I try to like force myself to get used to it, and eventually you will develop a like kind of like muscle memory. It was like, just you, you can just like switch switch files like modify code, or or get getting here, getting there like really, really quick. And after you pass through that learning curve, and you'll you'll find out using vime is very like satisfiable things, because cause that that the cause, the efficiency is totally different when using user interface, you don't have to like, use your mouse to to select this. Select that everything you do is on the keyboard, and you can. Your your hands will never like. Leave your keyboards, and you can, you can finish everything on it.

You can easily like, like, find some instructions or some arrows. You can, you can find a solution in stack, overflow, and and like, for nowadays, actually, the vim config file you can. You can just ask Gpt to to help you modify this. It is very, very useful. I mean, it's a it's a game changer like before the Gpt.

That's a that's a good question. So actually, for the 1st reason, the the main reason is when I started, use me. I'm about like, like, 20 years ago, 20 years old. And I just I just think spin is so cool like like, if you like doing this, it just looks like the hacker. And you you feel like, open your terminal and the Starbucks, and you just you just you just feel so good. That's just a teenager things to me. But but actually. Another reason is that there's so many people in the community, the developer community, or they? There are so many people recommend themes, and I know there's a bunch of like like like very famous developer, like like the inventor of C, plus plus. I forget his name, but he also used beam, and, like many, many like old old school superstar engineer, use vime, and everyone recommended, and everyone just say the learning curve is deep, but you have to get past free, and you will get very comfortable. So actually, those kind of things just supported, supported me to like, try to get used to it. And I I kind of, I kind of like, very satisfied about it, like, currently. But yeah, but actually, this is not a topic. But, like recently, I gradually find find like being is it's it's like actually, for for now I think, Vs code, or something like that, will gradually pass, being cause cause. You can also make Vs code like very similar to your vim. And I think it's like 2024. Nobody has has time to like to like sort things out like in a config file that's actually complicated. And and also when you have to develop like front end stuff and the front end stuff. Just need your editor to to like, show some some colors, something like that. And being couldn't support that. And yeah, so especially for for front end development, I won't recommend using being currently. But you can. Maybe you can sort things out. I don't know but that that will cost that will cost cause like much effort. Yeah. Yeah. But but basically, I still using me is another option. And it also also helps you to develop on the server.

Exactly do you think is like cool about it like, is it? The feeling of you being like a hacker? Or what exactly is it?

And if you like, need to like, keep your hands to get your mouse to like select screen. I don't. I think that's not cool, you know. Yeah, I think, yeah, I think the developer the cool developer. He can, like, like, source, manage, everything's out just using the keyboard. You can like, switch, just just typing in the keyboard. Yeah. And that's actually oh, I think it's cool. Yeah. But but now I am like, I'm about to get 30 years old. So I actually, I don't care about how cool I am anymore. Right now. Yeah, yeah. But yeah, but I still like, I get used to it.

But can you tell me a time when you were like still trying to learn it, and your stuff for you to like use it. But you still wanted to use it. What did you do to force yourself.\n\nStakeholder: Yeah, so actually, what did I do? I just, I just delete Bs code in my in my computer. yeah. And and actually, when you like. Try to when you try to like using veem in your real world project like, like, for example, back back to the time I started using veem. I was, I was working on my my master, my master project, because I I got a master degree back years ago. And and when I yeah. Yeah. So so when I, when I like, need to like doing the project doing some real project that will affect your maybe your salary or your graduation, and you will force yourself to learn it. And and yeah, so and I actually I think it takes like like one month or 2 months to to let me can can, like successful, successfully develop things by vein. But but you have. It has to like, take years to like fully integrate yourself into that system, because, cause you will like the your like, your plugins, your your tools, you you will like, gradually increase like I didn't use Tmox that much in the beginning when I use them. But but actually, tmox and vin, you have to like combine both of them to to maximize your efficiency. So so, yeah, so the improvement, actually, actually, the learning curve is steep is steep. But the improvement you you will get gradually improvement. And actually, you will take years, because because it's muscle memory. But yeah, but but in fact, if you, if you learn it, learn something slow and you will never forget it. So it's actually, yeah, this kind of like, like memory will like building in my muscle.

Why do you think they're copying? It is Vs code not good enough? Or is vim that much better or.\n\nStakeholder: Well, okay, yeah, I I didn't mean a Vs code coffee. Bean, actually, yeah, I just, I just think, yeah, actually, I totally, I don't think Vs code is bad. I think Vs code is very, very good, because actually, Vs code can integrate so many things like you can integrate your aws server, you can integrate your Github actions. You can. You can just simply combine the whole Cicd process in Vs code, and that is actually very, very helpful. And what I what I mentioned about the relation of Vs code and being. And how how do I like like review my workflow right now? Is that actually, you can install being plugins in Vs code. and you will just. And you you can in Vs code, can perfectly integrate with by your beam config file so you can. You can like like easily turn turn your Vs code just looks like your beam and also leverage the the strengthness or Vs code like like it also has a bunch of extension, and is so easy to customize, and it has it. Can. It can like integrate so many Ci CD things and github things something like that. And that is that is what I talked about. The comparison between Veeam and Vs code nowadays. Yeah, cause I think eventually Vs code. Actually, actually, I think, Vs code already passed. Veen right now, because it is so, it is like, so it is like so complete for developer. You can only use use Vs code to to like to to complete everything. But if you choose to use mean, you have to like customize so many things you have to like, install so many things you have to. You have to keep growing your your customized file. You have to keep it. You have to like, make it portable to every, every, to every device. And that is actually that pretty pretty mess. And for Vs code, you can just you can just use the account and and all of your setting will store in that account, and you can activate your setting on every device that is way more easier. So yeah, so so actually, for nowadays for me, I I don't use being like I don't. I don't like only using. I also use Vs code for some some sort of scenario and also for compiler Vs code actually integrates compiler better than being can also, like Vin can can just like do some some suggestion of the code.

But I still, I still enjoy coding in terminal. Actually, I still think it's cool. Yeah. So yeah, so for me, I don't think we need to like like, stick to a single tool for a developer.

So the device. So like, actually, it just changed by the time. But actually like, for example, like 10 years ago, like people just just get satisfied by. If the editor can support like syntax, highlighting can support like like auto suggestion, and you can. You can ease easily manage your file, and that is actually sufficient. Yeah, as actually sufficient for editor. But but nowadays, actually, actually, I think the requirement is is created by the product cause cause. Nowadays. Vs. Code, you can like manage like so many things on on a single app, like, for example, like 10 years ago, the developer. Maybe they they have to like like use use any editor to modify the code, and they have to use the command line to like, like, build the code like or deploy the code, and you have. They have to like, like, go to the the azure, or aws page to to see how it goes to manage the the the infrastructure of the whole system. And and yeah, that actually, the whole devops looked like like from develop from Co review, from from monitoring, from testing people pre, people like 10 years ago. They they use they they do those things by different interface. Like they they code in in editor and do the testing on maybe some sort of web interface and do the code Review do the the server things on the editor something like that. But nowadays actually, vs, culture integrate. Everything's everything's the every like like the whole pipeline is integrating Vs code like, like. like, for example, start at coding.

So the device. So like, actually, it just changed by the time. But actually like, for example, like 10 years ago, like people just just get satisfied by. If the editor can support like syntax, highlighting can support like like auto suggestion, and you can. You can ease easily manage your file, and that is actually sufficient. Yeah, as actually sufficient for editor. But but nowadays, actually, actually, I think the requirement is is created by the product cause cause. Nowadays. Vs. Code, you can like manage like so many things on on a single app, like, for example, like 10 years ago, the developer. Maybe they they have to like like use use any editor to modify the code, and they have to use the command line to like, like, build the code like or deploy the code, and you have. They have to like, like, go to the the azure, or aws page to to see how it goes to manage the the the infrastructure of the whole system. And and yeah, that actually, the whole devops looked like like from develop from Co review, from from monitoring, from testing people pre, people like 10 years ago. They they use they they do those things by different interface. Like they they code in in editor and do the testing on maybe some sort of web interface and do the code Review do the the server things on the editor something like that. But nowadays actually, vs, culture integrate. Everything's everything's the every like like the whole pipeline is integrating Vs code like, like. like, for example, start at coding. And you start and you build code and you integrate your test framework and you deploy it to your server. And actually, you can do code review on Vs code. So so like people before, don't imagine that actually, and the requirements is actually created by the product. So yeah.\n\nInterviewer: Hmm, okay. Can you?

And and I I will use the terminal to like, build a code to test it and and push it to the code base like Github. And after after that I will like open my browser to like, for example, to go Github like or to review others, others code to like merge code into into our product branch something like that.

Everything can be finished on Vs code, so that the workflow is slightly changed for now. Yeah. So I I'm still like like getting getting me used to it. I will.

And and when in stack overflow you can just find, like at any any issues you will, you will occur it when you're using beam, and maybe there will be some developers answer questions on that and on that platform.
