So there's a rule called a Matthews effect. I don't know if you heard it before. It's it's Well, let me try to explain it. So when most of the people are using one app. So in this case it's the IM app, so everybody is going to use it. And if you are trying to look for an IM app, you firstly use it because everybody around you is using this app. So it's almost my case for me to use this app because everybody around me is using wechat.

Sure. So it's a app on your iphone or your android phone. So when I open wechat you will see a search bar on top of the screen where you could type some name of your friends or your families where you could find you could find them. and the main section displays a list of chats with different contacts or groups, or maybe some subscriptions, and each entries will show, set the contacts profile, picture their names and a preview of the latest messages and the time of the last message that was received, and at the bottom of the screen there is a navigation bar with 4 tabs, and the 1st tab is called chat, which we just described. So the second tab is called Contacts tab. Where this tab, this tab will take the user to their contacts list where you could find your friends, your families, and even your colleague. And the 3rd tab is called discover. and this tab might allow the user to explore the content like some social features. So, for example, I could post my photos or something new with myself, and when I post it here, other friends could just open this tab, and they could show my story or something else. Okay? And the last one is called me. And this is typically for assessing some personal profile settings or some options.

Well, actually, wechat that's very bad at managing messages. Well, it doesn't have the Channel concept. Well, there are only private chat or group chat in wechat. So it's a it's an I'm app among friends that you really know, instead of some strangers, so it doesn't have the Channel concept.

No matter, it's a group chat or a private chat will just simply pop up.

And it's very funny that the most useful feature in wechat. In fact, I would say, is the payment system. Yeah, it's the payment system. Yeah. So Wechat actually combines some financial features where you could bind your credit card or debit card and transfer your money to your friends or a merchant like a restaurant.

The merchant or my friend could scan the QR code, and I could confirm that I going to transfer some kind of money some amount of money like $100 to him, and I could, when I confirm it will scan my face. Use some face Id or something else, or my fingerprint, and it will. My money will transfer to them. Yeah. this is the yeah, it, I would say.

Well, actually, it's very complicated. You could scan others. QR code to make a payment. And actually, on the other hand, you could show your QR.

Yeah.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "46", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Oh, I see. So is it like I you can. Oh, from your sample like you have a credit card like save inside one of your chat.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "47", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "I I see your point here. So the image actually is some message that I sent before be for example, like 20 days before I send my credit card image, my picture of a picture of my credit card to my girlfriend. And then and today I want to look for the picture of this credit card. So if if without this feature, I have to scroll up to the certain day like 20 days before, and look for the picture.

We stapled, yeah.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "48", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "I see. So the we can I confirm something so you can search of an image by text.

Yeah.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "50", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Was so.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "51", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "We do via text.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "52", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Okay. Why are these features important to you? Like you. I guess you mentioned 2 main features one is the payment, and second is the searching capability.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "53", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Okay, I would say, it's not because they are important, but just because they are very common. Yeah, it's very common scenarios that you might use it every day, so it becomes my favorite features.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "54", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Let me see. Are there any tasks that you find challenging or frustrating? When using this app? If there are any, can you describe a specific instance.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "55", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Oh, yeah, yeah. And oh, sometimes I need to transfer some files to my friends, yeah, it's another common scenarios. Yeah. And but wechat will limits the size of the file to be transferred like, I couldn't remember. Well, but it's gonna be 25, a million bytes. Yeah. 25 MB, so I have to save my file on some cloud drive and send a link to my friends for them to download the file.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "56", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "I see. So your main problem is when sending a file, there's a limit. So you have to upload it in the 3rd party app and send the link instead right.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "57", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Yeah, yeah, it's totally correct.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "58", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "I see, I see. Is there any other task that you find challenging or frustrating.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "59", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Yeah, I think it's the messages itself. So let me explain it. Maybe for some concerns of privacy or cost of storage wechat will not store. We will not store any messages on clock, so which means that all the messages are on your phone. You cannot assess it via the server of Wechat. So whenever I have to change my phone, for example, I buy a new phone. Yeah, I have to manually and transfer all the messages to a new phone. Yeah, that's the point. Here. It it's very time consuming. Yeah.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "60", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "I see. So basically, there's no backup for your messages. So you basically have to do your backup and restore manually if you want to move phones. Is that correct?", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "61", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's almost correct.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "62", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Oh, okay.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "63", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Yeah.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "64", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "No.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "65", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Would say that as long as you lose your phone all the messages are gone and you could never back. Yeah.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "66", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Yeah, right? Right? Okay, have you encountered any obstacles? like the head, for example, that prevented you from achieving your main goals while using this app?

If you could improve one aspect of this messaging app what would it be? And why.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "71", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Oh, I I would say the most important one would be the cloud storage for all the messages. Yeah, I wanna keep all my messages available all the time, but it just occupies much of my iphone storage, and so if we just supports this feature, I could save my space, and I don't need to worry anymore when I change my phone. Yeah.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "72", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "I see. Okay. I guess that's about it. Thank you for sharing your experience and insights before we wrap up.

I find those interesting. And this is another major aspect of reading news is getting to know getting to know about politics, both Indian and American politics as it as it affects us.

There's no point of reading that article, because I might. I might have already been. I might have already read it somewhere else.

They tend to spam a lot in in a day, and this might lead to missing a few important news that would really affect me. so one, the spam thing spamming a lot of notifications about various news is one thing that that is a challenge that I'm like I have to. I have to curate the notifications according to different applications, to work with it. And another challenge is with this, with these greater publications or larger publications, the articles have a huge amount of content in them. So reading an article like reading an article of, say a thousand words in a limited in a limited amount of time is not, is not very possible, is not very efficient. So a huge, like the huge content in these articles, is also a challenge that I am that I have been facing with, and would I would love to have smaller content for some of for for some of the articles to get up to speed with.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "14", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Okay?

I received a lot of notifications from these news article websites, and I missed the the opening ticketing date for the for this concert, which is why I was not able to buy a ticket for the concert like wasn't able to buy a ticket for this concert.

And another thing would be if the article is smaller but comprehensive, it would be a great experience if the article is, if the article or the news content is small, but it is, it covers every aspect of the it covers every aspect of the event, or whatever it is talking about.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "18", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Okay?

Because it gives perfect news articles that I am really interested to read in. And if I'm using mobile applications for these for these news for the news portals, I have notifications also also provide to be a great what do we say? Great channel to receive news updates because they track my, they kind of track my behavior.

And that is why that is one concern that I have with automated news curation systems that if they are able to.

They have a different what do we say? Different normal length, that all of the articles have. So that is one that is one aspect that I that I would compare different sources. On. Another thing is timing. Major news corporations have a pretty good have a pretty good timing where they just. but they just like publish the news within the within a short amount of time of the event happening. That is a that is a great source. But again, it also depends on it also depends on the size of the publication. If it is a greater publication, the times are shorter, it is a larger publication, it is smaller publications. The times are longer. And again, another thing that I I think that I compare different sources are the stances that they take on several issues. So if I read an article about about someone speaking about a certain issue, we can just, we can differentiate the different sources from the stance that they take on some source.

It tracks my habits and it like, it shows the news that I am interested in on the Google search on the Google search page that that has been a great thing.

So you don't get what do we say you don't get You don't get news from only one source, and you don't only see one side of that news you get to see multiple sites.

They don't spam a lot. And the notifications that I get are pretty much are very useful. When I when I click on them.

So for some news you don't want to see some news related to some related to some topic related to some event, there should be a feature to disable that topic.

Recommendations based on my habits, based on my interests that I've found that I've been that I've been going through another. Yeah, Major, important thing is another important thing is navigations, navigations through various news and navigations, through the homepage to the article to the related articles the articles which are similar to the article that you have just read, and articles that you have. That articles that you have been reading, so navigation is an important part. You should not like the as as an user should not get very confused while navigating, and another part would be how user friendly the application of the portal is if I have to.

They should not be able to use this data to push some agenda of their own, or to push some push, some propaganda of their own using my data. So data privacy is, I am.

I'm the interviewer. Thank you for agreeing to participate in this interview the purpose of this interview is to understand how you use Linkedin as an professional networking platform. This interview should take about 5 to 10\u00c2\u00a0min. Your insights will be always valuable in understanding the user experiences with Linkedin. So let me start with a simple question, what is Linkedin to you?", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "1", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "So Linkedin is, I mean, in my view, is mostly a kind of networking platform. There's kind of a couple of key things that I do on it. But by and large it's, you know, viewed as a professional networking platform, which is, you know. in parallel to a lot of the other social media. It exists out there just to allow kind of professionals to connect and you know, live in the business world.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "2", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Perfect so when you use linkedin like, right so what do you try to prioritize on the platform and maybe can you dive deep on. Why doing? Why are you doing that?", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "3", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "So some of the things that I do on Linkedin are going to be networking just connecting with other colleagues, or maybe kind of past classmates see what they're up to. We do a lot of marketing especially in my field. We work with a lot of other professionals. In some areas, you know, marketing the exposure, there is far better than we might get, you know, through Google ads or Facebook out of other channels. So we focus a lot on marketing. We do a lot of recruiting as well through Linkedin. just good source a lot of people. And it's fairly low cost compared to some of the other competitors. And then even looking for jobs for myself. Yeah, sometimes it's nice to kind of poke around. See what else is out there in the world, and just see what some of the salary ranges and things like that, you know, always keeps you motivated. So it's a nice resource to be able to just again keep an eye or ear to the ground, look around, and then the last is probably events. A lot of organizations will post, you know. Hey, we have an upcoming conference, or we have this or that, and you know I I don't really. I drink from the fire hose of emails and there's no chance that I would be able to otherwise keep up with everything. So it's nice that when I have the availability, and I think I, you know, can have the bandwidth. I can go on and check and see kind of what events are, you know, being put on the community.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "4", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Really good to hear that there's a lot of information to process. Yeah, that actually leads me to the next question. Right? So in a professional setting. How does Linkedin contribute to your overall professional development?", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "5", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "So for my own professional development. I can't say it's actually played that much of a role. I think a lot of my career has been. you know, word of mouth. A lot of the jobs or kind of the opportunities have been, you know, through existing networks or kind of continuing to expand. So it's in terms of kind of professional development. It's mostly to just signal to like my other to my clients, for example, that I I. You know I exist. I'm a person who, you know, has credentials, and I have, you know, degrees, and it just lends a little bit of a you know. a bit of credibility. And so it really doesn't play much of a role in terms of professional development. It's more of just a you know, another resource for people to check in and just make sure. Okay, I'm not like a Scammer. I'm not a, you know. If they get an email from me I am who I say I am, and the picture there matches the picture that they see on, you know, Zoom, or or you know, when I meet in person. So yeah.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "6", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Got it. Got it? So when you talk about Linkedin, right? So what specific features of Linkedin do you find most useful? And maybe why on that.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "7", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "I think the place I'd start is one. I think a lot of the marketing resources are are pretty good. I mean, they do charge you an arm and a leg. So I think cost is definitely a consideration there. But I do think that their reach and the network itself is good, and then some of the tools that they have to like post you know, marketing things are are very, very easy and user friendly. So kind of makes it again, a good tool for any sort of broad based marketing you can get, you know, pretty targeted. They have like recommendations. You can pay to have it be recommended a little bit more. And that process is just really simple. They just tell you here's how much it's gonna cost. And you know, here's how much it's gonna get boosted. So you can kind of keep track of all your impressions and all of your different marketing metrics. So I think that is kind of place a. And then the other thing that I found really helpful is, I did like when they purchased Linda, which was their kind of e-learning platform. You know, there is some kind of helpful stuff. If you want to do kind of a quick, deep dive into a certain. You know technology stack, or you want to kind of get a better understanding of like, how do I, you know, do something in marketing a little bit better. that was actually one of the better places to go, because in terms of quality it would definitely exceed. You know what you might find on Youtube or some of those other resources. And yeah, it just felt like a more, you know, professional and polished place to to get that information.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "8", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Exactly. Exactly. It makes sense. So can you walk me through the process of using Linkedin? Maybe for one of your typical professional task.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "9", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Sure. So I think the task would probably be kind of posting, marketing information are posting like a marketing post just for awareness. So let's say, I'm at a conference. And yeah, something interesting is happening. Typically what we'll do is yeah, post something about it. So to do that kind of. I'm gonna walk through this, you know, as I'm looking at it. What I would do is log in. And at the top there's a big button. They make it very easy. You can't miss it. Which says, just start a post. and from there I can choose because I operate the Linkedin for my company, as well as for kind of my special profile. I can toggle between one or both, so if I'm posting as myself. I would choose myself. I can write my post. and they have, you know, a couple of little tools where I can embed, you know. images, videos, or, you know. kind of create a little more pop and circumstance, like nice backgrounds and emojis. And then, when I'm done I can hit this post button, or I can schedule it for later. So there's a nice little clock icon that allows me to say, All right. Actually, you know, most people are going to be logging in, probably tomorrow morning. And so it doesn't really make sense, you know, in the evening, to post it. It's just not going to get as many impressions. So I'm going to be posted at, you know. 9 Am. Tomorrow, when people 1st show up at the office, and I'll get a nice kind of boost in some of the impressions. So once I've posted it, it goes out to the network and it's on the feed, so I'll start to kind of get some interactions. And you know. hopefully, eventually win some business.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "10", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Yeah, yeah, you have made it sound so simple. Yeah, so so one major part you have talked about is like to create the professional network. Right? So what steps do you take when you wanted to connect with new professionals on Linkedin.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "11", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "So I don't often kind of reach out and connect with you know other folks. It's like more. If it's somebody I know, I'll reach out and add them but I don't reach out too much as kind of cold call or cold. Add So in those cases. yeah, maybe I'll search for their name if there's somebody that I'm you know, interested in learning more about. Maybe they're a C, you know, c-suite at a company that we're looking to sell to. I want to get a little background on them, I'll you know, search them in the search function, pull up their profile, kind of take a quick look at their background to see if there's any kind of common threads, and then maybe I'll you know I'll add them.

Okay.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "13", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Probably use it a couple of days a week, maybe. Yeah, most days. I'll need to like check it at least once or yes, I'd say, let's let's call it 4 out of 5 days a week I'm on Linkedin in some way, shape or form.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "14", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Yeah, that's pretty good number, actually. do you have any any other professional networking platforms in your mind? And when you compare to Linkedin, and what you can use.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "15", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "I don't really. I think there's kind of a couple of tools that overlap, for example, recruiting like the Laravel community is pretty small. And you know, Lara jobs. If you post something there, you actually get better candidates than you might get from yeah posting something on Linkedin. So in terms of recruiting. Some tools are just better, but in terms of like professional development. I think Linkedin is rare in that. It's kind of the only game in town. That's kind of carved out this niche.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "16", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Got it. So when are you using when you're using the Linkedin right? What kind of obstacles or frustrations do you, and generally encounter? And how do you overcome them?", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "17", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "So I think one frustration would be, you know, sometimes the amount of ads and the amount of you know targeted stuff feels a little much. It just kind of clouds your feed, and there's a lot of irrelevant stuff there. So I'd say that would probably be the biggest frustration. And then certain parts of the interface. our just too cluttered. I think they throw a lot of information just to make it very busy. They want you click it everywhere. But in certain cases, yeah, I'm there for a reason. I have a mission. I gotta post something. I want to turn that into, you know impressions, and having that, all of this other stuff is kind of just added noise. And I yeah, don't necessarily care for it.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "18", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Yeah, yeah. Got it? So as an hardcore user of Linkedin, right? So how do you think Linkedin has evolved since you started using it. Any thoughts on that.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "19", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Think it hasn't. I mean its core hasn't evolved much for the most part, you know, since it was acquired by Microsoft, it hasn't changed a great deal. It's been, you know, pretty steady and loyal to its, you know, to its following, I think what it's tried to focus on a lot more is, you know, marketing tools so becoming a lot more targeted so that your posts make in front of the right people. So I've kind of watched. Some of those tools, you know. Get a little bit better. They built, you know, there's some new like AI tools to help with developing content for posts. Yeah, that's pretty new and interesting. And then. you know, early on, they didn't necessarily have Linda as kind of the e-learning stuff, but they? They brought that in, as you know, way to expand their capabilities. And so, yeah, that was kind of a a big area for growth for them.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "20", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Makes sense.

I don't think there's too much off the top of my head.

Let's maybe start off with Youtube shots.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "19", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Yeah, sure. So Youtube shorts is basically a short form content. That you can access through one of the tabs under Youtube. And after one video is played, usually another short video starts playing and your feed can be personalized, based on your watching habits. And sorry. What was the other question.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "20", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Yeah, I just wanted to know, like, what's your purpose when you're using Youtube shorts. And when you're using the long form content.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "21", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "So Youtube shorts is when I'm bored and I want to be entertained. or when I just want to. you know, think about other things. So I just need like a quick like something to occupy my mind. Distract myself. And long form content is, for when like I said I'd I'd want to dive deeper into a subject. That's when I watch like a full video.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "22", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Interesting. Yeah, that's that's definitely 2 different use cases. So how frequently do you use Youtube as a whole?", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "23", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "I use Youtube very frequently. I would say, I use it every day. So on my phone, I usually use it for Youtube shorts and regarding long form content. I like to keep it playing in the background sometimes when I'm performing like other tasks on my laptop.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "24", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Oh, that's interesting. So if it's playing in the background, are are you listening only to the audio? Or do you also manage to watch the video at the same time.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "25", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "No, I listen mainly to the audio. I don't have that much patience for watching the video most of the time. Yeah.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "26", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Got it got it. It makes sense. So you mentioned that you use Youtube both on mobile phones as well as on laptops. Are there any other devices that you use to access Youtube.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "27", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "No! That's it.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "28", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Okay. And what would you say is, let's say, the split between watching on Mobile and watching on laptop.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "29", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Split in terms of frequency. Mobile phone would be more frequent just because it's more accessible. And but time, I think laptop would definitely be more, because if I'm opening my laptop it's to sit down and complete a set of tasks. so maybe like for 3, 4\u00c2\u00a0h at a stretch. So I may be using Youtube for maybe an hour of that at least.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "30", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "So that's a that's a quite a different way of looking at both of those that's nice to know. So can you just tell me like on an average day. How much time would you spend on Youtube shorts if you open up in your mobile app like you do.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "31", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "I think it would mostly be like filler time or time to unwind. So I would say, maybe 15\u00c2\u00a0min, twice a day.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "32", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "15\u00c2\u00a0min twice a day. And what would that be for the desktop version and the long form content.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "33", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "So that's been changing, depending on the other tasks that I'm doing, whether I need something in the background or not. So yeah, on days, if I need something on the background, I would say, like, one r easily of Youtube. But if I don't, if I can't have something playing in the background then, would probably not use it at all.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "34", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Got it, got it. So let's just say, in an average week. how many hours do you think that would work out to combining both of those.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "35", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "On a week. I guess you can multiply like 30 into 7 would be 200 and 10\u00c2\u00a0min. and.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "36", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "You can give me a rough number. Don't worry about it being too accurate.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "37", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Yeah, in terms of the video long form. I think maybe 2, 3 times a week would be like you could say, maybe 2 and a half hours. 2 and a half hours, plus how much is 210\u00c2\u00a0min in hours?", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "38", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Okay, okay. I think that's good to me.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "39", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Okay.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "40", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Thanks for confirming that. Let's go ahead and shift to a different aspect. Could you maybe help me with, like the 5 most important things that you use Youtube for.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "41", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "I use it to listen to things more than watching things.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "42", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Got it.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "43", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "And by 5 most important things, do you mean like types of videos or.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "44", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "It could be anything you want it. It could be types of videos like you said. whatever you think is important for you wherever you feel like you get some value out of the time that you spend on Youtube. It might be like, like you said scrolling through the app or just in in a break period, it might be watching any long form content in the background, like you said just yes.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "45", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "So those would be 2 more like one would be like unwinding with Youtube shorts. the other would be playing long form content in the background. Then 3.rd Another use. That is not that frequent but does happen. Is playing videos to fall asleep like leaving some sort of white noise on. Yeah. I would say. Those are like the 3 main and listening to music, probably to be sick.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "46", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "So there are a lot of different ways that you use Youtube, you know, to know how everybody does this. Would you mind elaborating on what sort of long form content would you watch since you mentioned you watch it in the background? How does that work for you?", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "47", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "So I think the kind of content I play is conducive to being played in the background. I would say. you know podcasts or streams where I'm not really that concerned about, like the person's facial expressions as much. And I can just get the value from the content just by listening to them. or audiobooks.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "48", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Interesting. Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense. So when you're using it to, let's say, listen for music, or you're scrolling just to rewind like you mentioned. Do you happen to look for any specific genres, or like types of content that you prefer watching while on Youtube.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "49", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "So I don't specifically have to live very much. I think my Youtube feed is pretty person. So I don't spend that much time searching. I can just click around in my Youtube recommendations most of the time. and especially for shorts. I don't think I ever search for anything in shorts. And it's also really hard to search in shorts. So it's just whatever the algorithm gives me.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "50", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Interesting. That's a definitive approach. So you mentioned that things are personalized to you. So do you follow any specific like creators or channels. or anything else on the platform, as well.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "51", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "That's actually such a like good thing to point out, because it would make sense for me to, I guess. But I don't. I think, just based off of my viewing history. It's my feed has been customized.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "52", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Interesting. That's that's a very different way to approach it. Wow! That's that's new and unique. So can you tell me, how like did you get started with this viewing history, trying to make it work the best way for you. Do you log in, do you like? How does it all work.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "53", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Yeah. So I do log in until a couple of years I actually did had paused viewing history on Youtube. But I realized that I wasn't getting as much value as I wanted from it, because, a lot of times on Youtube, I just wanted them to give me recommendations, and I didn't, and seeing recommendations that were not related to what I wanted to watch all over my feed was pretty annoying when all I wanted to do was relax. Right? So I actually switched on viewing history. And I sign in with my Google account, too. What should you do.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "54", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Interesting. That's that's definitely experience that would make you change things. So was there a specific reason you switched off this watch history feature? Could you tell me a little bit more about it?", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "55", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Why, I had switched it off in the past.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "56", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Yeah. And could you tell me, what? What does this do?", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "57", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "I think I was still trying to figure out how the Internet works. And I think one of my Google's account, Google account was my university account, so I didn't know like how much of that information I wanted on there. But then, eventually I realized that there aren't like any down any like visible downsides to me. To leave the watch history on. And there are upsides of me having a personalized feed. So that's what made me change the decision.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "58", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Got it. I think that makes a lot of sense. Let's get back to the genre. Suspect. Is there any specific category of content that you typically prefer watching for short form and the same for long form.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "59", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "I don't think there is a category for either of them.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "60", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Okay, interesting. And you mentioned that you do not follow any creators. But do you save any videos to maybe come back to? Or how do you do that? If if there's something you like, and you want to revisit that somehow.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "61", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Okay. So if there's anything I want to revisit, I remember it well enough to go back and watch it. I've never had to. I've never had the thought of like safe to watch later, or like any of that. I don't think that works for me. because if I'm going to revisit it. It already has to be on my mind, and if it's not, then I don't want to go back to a list I want to like, start afresh and see what I'm feeling it. In that moment.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "62", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Got it. That's that's a definite way of going through with it. and makes a marked impact view as well. Thanks for sharing that for me. I have one last question for you in in this domain regarding the goals that you mentioned to me earlier. like, why do you think they are important to you. Is there? Somehow they affect your day to day routine. Do they make things better or worse for you in any way?", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "63", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Yeah, I think. They're pretty helpful in terms of routine, where sometimes you just want to space out and have a moment to yourself, and this usually happens to me like as soon as I wake up when I'm trying to transition from whatever headspace I was in while sleeping like if I had a dream or something to like, bring myself back down to reality. mindlessly scrolling on Youtube helps. And the other is. when I come back from the cave, and I want to like, eat and relax for a bit before I get started with homework again. That's when it it's also really helpful.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "64", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Budget. Okay, interesting.

For example, if I'm solving a lead code problem, it helps me if I'm watching. If I'm playing something in the background that's talking about like something entirely different, like psychology. For example. so that helps me focus on like. keep both sets of my problem solving. Mind focused. And for some reason that helps me. instead of just trying to solve. make, instead of just trying to make sense of like one thing at a time, it sometimes helps to do both at the same time. But sometimes it doesn't work, sometimes When I get too deep into my work I have to go back and and see what video is being played, because, I would have completely zoned out whatever video was being played in the background, and it would have changed. And I wouldn't even have noticed. So depends. Really, yeah.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "66", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "That's that's a quite interesting way of watching long Form garden using it to sort of mix things up for your brain while you're working on something else.

Duration has 3 options under 4\u00c2\u00a0min, 4 to 20\u00c2\u00a0min, or over 20\u00c2\u00a0min. and the other one that I may use sometimes is the upload date which has options of last hour today, this week, this month, this year.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "134", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Interesting.

It's like hard to find a short once you watched it because you remember random details about it. but like the song playing in the background, maybe something like that.

Long form content. No complaints. Okay, except for sometimes when I leave like a video on to sleep. and then it goes into advertisements, I don't mind.

I will 1st market. and then, if those are like trash or spam, I will just delete it. and then I will. Read those emails that that is important.

So I think, this is something that email clients currently do not support, which could turn out be a super useful feature for customers. Thank you for raising that.

Make sure that it gets in I get what you mean. so I think we've covered a good amount of what as well we started with. Why, you'd like to use emails.

It's to yeah, to save these valuable resources, you know, to save these valuable resources somewhere to for me to be able to check them later, either because I need them in the in my current job, or because I recall oh, I read this some, some the other some other day, and now I don't have access to it, so I think that will be the second feature. Yeah. I think the 3rd feature will be. I mean, we probably didn't discuss this.

For Snapchat. It's very easy for me to connect to stay connected to my friends in real time. So Snapchat basically allows you to like, take pictures and just send it instantaneously to your friends. They are just view one's photos photos or videos. So right now, like, I'm in us.

So with just a few prompts, I'm able to generate professional emails to a lesser extent, personal emails as well.

Secondly, I think that you'll be It'll be pivotal if we can move from just using these a assistance in the manner that we currently use them in the sense you ask questions and you get responses. If we can move from that model to having large language agents instead of large language models. Then maybe I could describe tasks for it to go and perform, and then it could go and perform those tasks. It could be something like I, I could ask you to write an email. And instead of it giving me the response of an email that I could copy and paste in my email client and then send it.

This is really just me working on my own personal projects on ad hoc basis, and with the same case use case of pushing and pulling. I'd be working maybe 1\u00c2\u00a0h per week.

If I went to the Example Repository, I get brought to a new page with a bunch of toggle switch tabs if I can list them, their code issues pull request. Is that what I will talk about? Actions, projects, wiki security insights and settings. So pull request. If I click on. That is like the main one that I use. No, no, it's only my teammates. Essentially, if I have a github or a git branch that I want to with with changes that I want to see in the main branch so like what would be actually submitted, I would go and click on, pull request, go to the right side of my screen and press a green button, called New pull request. Then you would be brought to a screen that says, compare changes on the top for the title, and below that there's a banner that takes up the full width of the screen with a base branch and a compare Branch, and the Compare Branch is the branch with the changes you want to push to the brace branch. So if I were to have an example branch and my main branch, the base would be main, and compare would be example. and after doing that, I can click, create, pull request, which is on a green button. and it will lead me to a page with text input to input a title for the pull request, and a description box which is just below the title for the port request.

If there was a way now, I could look at the commit history, which all have timestamps. So it's all like very much a linear stack of changes you could look at, but it's it very much.

Sometimes I still go to the grocery store in person and other times I don't. So that's I was like trying to figure out about like, how often I do online versus just going person. And to your last question. I think I'll do. My motivation for online grocery shopping are. if I have like, a really busy week, and I don't have time to physically go or if I'm just buying the same things that I always buy and like don't need to explore.

So I'll open a web browser. I'll do the Amazon example and navigate to Amazon. and typically, I'll just like. go to the search bar. And then at the top, there, there's a i think there's a whole foods button. Yeah, all the way at the bottom. I scroll all the way down to whole foods. and then I'll start typing in like then I'll have, like my grocery list available for the week, and then I'll type in like pasta and sometimes I'll forget to select whole foods. and I'll have to like kind of go back and refilter that because an annoying thing that happens, if I don't do whole foods 1st is like I'll add things to my cart that aren't available at my local whole foods, so it'll be like an way to shop.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "27", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Yeah.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "28", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Yeah.

So you mentioned that you find sometimes, you know. it's a little difficult to just add items to the cart, and you sometimes forget to select whole foods from which you want to order things. So how how easy do you find the experience? So does the app 1st ask you to select the store before you start adding items to it? Or do you just intuitively. Just start adding items randomly, and then figure out later that you know you may have ordered, and added them to the wrong cart.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "32", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Hmm! That's a good question. Just to make sure I understand this is about if I add things that aren't available at my whole foods like, how do I handle that? Okay? Yeah. I think what happens if I don't like if I just start searching on Amazon and I type in pasta sometimes I'm trying to. I'm looking at it now, but like in my memory, there's like a whole foods icon that appears under the ones that like are actually available in whole foods. But it's not like that visible. So like, it's easy to miss. And I think what happens is, if you add it to your cart, and it's not available at whole foods. Then when you go to check out, there'll be like 2 separate checkout lists. One will be the whole foods one and then the other one will be like just all of Amazon. So that's helpful. But it is like a little bit annoying, because then, like all the ones that aren't in whole foods, I'll have to like go back and like research for it. But on the whole, I feel like it's pretty easy. It's just like a little bit overwhelming at times, because it feels exactly like Amazon. But it's you're only trying to do like a very small subset of all that Amazon has to offer. Yeah.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "33", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Yeah, that makes sense. So how easy is the experience of actually searching for a product. So you've selected whole foods. You're now looking for a product. You mentioned that you never use the explore tab, so do you directly search for specific products and add them.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "34", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Yeah, that's correct. I think it's really easy if I know in advance what I need for the week. Like if I have my grocery list all planned out. I feel like that part is more what's difficult, like figuring out exactly what I need for a month or 2 weeks. But then, once I have that list of things, it's a lot simpler. I feel like what I wish they had. They kind of have like in between version of what I wish they had. But I it would be cool if they could look at all of my past orders, and like come up with a grocery list for me. Oh, actually, now that I'm clicking on it now there is, you can click on, buy again. Wow! This is. I've never looked at this before, and then from there you can like add things that you've already bought before. So I might start using that.

Buy again.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "35", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Yeah, that makes sense. So yeah, I think, I completely agree with you. So, coming on to products that you do want to look for. Do you look for specific details when you're you know, buying. Even products that you would use say, on a weekly basis or something like that? Or do you look at specific details? And what details do you specifically look for when you're buying basic grocery items?

I think quantity is a little bit harder. It's not as intuitive when you're shopping online, because you kind of have to like. Read the fine print to see if you're getting like one bag of cat litter, or like 10 so I'll look at those details. Sometimes I'll have to look at ingredients because I'm allergic to nuts. So if I'm buying like brownies like fresh brownies I'll have to see if they have an ingredient list available which I'm not entirely sure they always do And yeah, actually sorry to jump back. But as I'm thinking out loud, it would be nice like if they could have almost a template grocery list that I could just like reuse every time that I customize, like my weekly grocery list versus my like party planning grocery list, or something like that.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "39", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "That's that's a great idea.

It's either like I know exactly what I want, or I'm like, more like, I know, a category of items I want. Then I just like start.

I think now that I'm reflecting on it, it's I'll I never looked at it, and I probably never will, because it contradicts why I'm going online grocery shopping in the 1st place, like I'm really there for efficiency. I'm not there to look around. It's different than me shopping for clothes like these groceries are like exactly what I want. And I don't wanna waste time like randomly exploring grocery items on my computer. I think personally, I prefer exploring in a physical grocery store if I have to do that. But I'm not very big on like cooking, so I don't know if this, maybe someone who cooks more would feel more comfortable navigating an online exploration of ingredients. but yeah, for me, it's just like I'm not interested really in that function when I'm shopping for food online.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "51", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "That makes sense, I think. yeah so you mentioned that you sometimes. You see products that you know it's it's it's hard to distinguish between products are generally available on Amazon versus specifically on the grocery store.

If they're out of stock of what you want, they'll have like sorry they'll have a an option to select either an alternative that you can pick, or the closest alternative that the store associate will pick, or just like not get it at all. So it kind of depends on the item for me, like for Pasta. I don't really care that much I'll just like, take whatever the store associate recommends as the closest option. But then, sometimes, if it's like more expensive and the alternative like, I'm thinking. Hmm! I think I ordered groceries at target one day, and like I was specifically looking for some type of ingredient.

Also, when I buy things in the whole food store and like, there's a lot of, I guess data sharing between like a physical place that I buy things and an online place.

So I think it would like reduce the amount of typing and clicking, and also be more comprehensive, because sometimes I just like, forget things like I'll kind of just go off of memory every time I'm doing this.

So time  efficiency is definitely a factor, and you find a lot of features which you don't end up using at the end of the day. You're specifically just typing in products and looking for them.

It seems to be very tailored to my needs. And what I'm like in the mood for today. Also, I find the ui and the user experience very smooth and like it's I, I don't have to click a lot of buttons to get started to watch a movie while I'm having my meal. so it feels very convenient to use.

This can be a live animation, a clip from the show or the movie. and it shows with a title along with a little description about the movie or the show and a play button and a more info button. If I don't want to watch that show or movie. I have options at the top given by Netflix that help me filter out based on home TV shows, movies. new and popular. And my list, which is basically the movies or shows I have planned to watch later on in the day later on, at any time when I feel like basically the show that I didn't get time to watch right now. it also offers a search bar which helps me navigate through any of the specific movie titles or specific shows that I wanna watch. you know, for me the option to change my profile or change the user or sign out from the application next to it. Below the main banner. They mostly show me the recommendation that they have. But even before that they show me the con continue watching for my Carousal. Basically, that carousal is a collection of all the TV shows or the movies that I was watching in the past usage of the app. But I didn't get time to complete. So this is a very helpful feature that I like about Netflix is that right where I left off they I'm able to get back into it in like a very short amount of time in a very convenient manner. So, for example, if I was watching breaking bad yesterday. I can just simply go to the breaking bads icon. It will expand a bit, and it will show me the option to start playing. to add it to my my list, to remove from my list. and to like or double like this also, it will show me how much of the episode I have already completed, and at what timestamp I am at. so it becomes very convenient to know what? At what point? I'm jumping into the series. And yeah, so it basically shows me array of all the movies or TV show that I was watching in the past instances of using the app. But I didn't get time to complete, and it helps me choose. If I want to continue watching the those cities or shows below them, there is a bunch of genres that they offer me based on my personalized content. I think they show me Bollywood.

So what section basically basically shows us. it shows the shows that are like similar to the show that I was currently watching. So. And it's a lesson that I would like to watch these shows as well. so I guess that is where Netflix shines like it is able to correctly identify what shows are in line with the similar show that I want to watch.

So I can prioritize what I want to watch and based on that, I can start watching the videos that want to get churned, churned this way.

So I browse my city's subreddit with keyword. Halloween, search to get information about that. So sometimes I just want to like scroll through topics. I follow like subreddits that I follow. So I log in just to kill some time following the subredd itself. So that's why I use it. So the when really ties into whenever I'm free, or whenever I need some information. Also. it could also be like, I also use Reddit as an alternative for stack overflow. So there are a lot of subreddits that are give like technical help or like code queries.

So I'll tell you how it differs from a Google search. So a Google search basically aggregates a lot of generalized search results. So let's pick an example where you know, I'm trying to integrate a new workout into my routine. So I really want to know how that workout has impacted other people, and how what kind of what kind of results they've seen from it. So instead of googling something like that, I'd go into Reddit and say that. So the reason for using it is that I get personal experiences over facts, and these personal experiences are mostly legitimate. So they and they're very contextual. So I feel that they're much more valuable than Google search. So that is so to like encapsulate. Why, I use it in one word, it's to get more targeted results to the problem that I'm facing.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "6", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Right? Right? Makes sense. what do you typically do when you like? First, st open Reddit.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "7", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Okay. So again, there are 2 main flows that I go through. So one is, if I open Reddit and I want to like, search for something specific. Then I open it through Google. So I Google, the question. And then I put Reddit after that. So it gives me all the relevant posts. So I just open the post directly and then I interact with the post was the other way. Is I open@it.com. I don't use the mobile app I think the mobile app design is really clunky, and there are a lot of 3rd party apps that are much better than that. But coming back to the point, so if I open Reddit through reddit.com, and the 1st thing you see, is the homepage. So the homepage is like a top bar where you have a search bar on top. You have messaging, you have. You can create a post. You have your notifications. All those are on top, and the top bar then below that the screen is divided into 3 parts, the left most is all your recently visited tabs you recently visited subreddits and the subreddits that you follow. The middle is kind of like a newsfeed with posts from subreddits that I follow, and on the right it's like posts you might be interested in. So it suggests posts that I might like. So I when I come on Reddit, I normally, if I have a targeted problem, then I go through the Google Link. If I don't. If I log in through reddit.com. I just scroll through the newsfeed till I find something that interests me, and I go into that post and interact with the post.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "8", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Alright?

The outcome of that usage of Reddit will result in the problem being solved. if I'm just browsing Reddit, just to look through my interesting subreddits, then there is no particular outcome. It's just that I just browse them to find and read something interesting. it might be a positive outcome where I find something really interesting to read. And then I have specific questions about it, and then I research it further on, Reddit.

So people, I don't think Reddit is a kind of platform where you interact with different people. So there are some communities where you can interact with people like. I'm not sure which ones. But there are some conversation subreddits where you can talk to people on live chat. But the point of Reddit is. I. I think, the USP. Of Reddit is anonymity, so it's really hard to trace a post back to the person, because none of their information is publicly visible except for the username which they can. which they can like, modify to not represent their real name. So I usually interact with posts, I would say, and communities and post within communities. not specific users or moderators, I mean, moderators interact with your post. So I don't post a lot. So I would say, I interact mostly with posts within communities. And to answer the second part of your question like, what communities. Am IA part of like? It's a it's a very wide variety of communities. So like, when I was applying to grad school, I was part of like grad admissions. I was part of a study abroad committee study abroad.

I've always interacted with like Cs career questions that subreddit lately I've been interacting on the university's subreddit. Also a lot because there are a lot of posts that people make like even a couple of days ago during fall break there were a lot of people reaching out to make plans to like, go around the city and like go to the museum and stuff like that. So I I wouldn't say I interact with a certain type of post. But, I would say that any post that comes on my feed is pretty tailored to my specifications. So I normally interact with all the posts that come on my feed.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "20", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Makes sense. So just coming to the the processes.

Could you walk me through the steps you take when you want to post something or like comment on a specific credit post.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "21", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Got it so I would say I've never posted something on reddit like in like. So I see credit posts. Can be classified into 2 tests. One of them is like posts asking for advice or asking for solutions, and the second is like posts about your experience about something which others can draw insights from. So most of the posts that I've done are posts asking for advice. I'd say I've asked for a lot of questions in like Cs career questions and grad school admissions where? It's helpful to ask for advice. So going through like specifically how I post when I log in to reddit.com I go. So I previously mentioned that there's a top bar of notifications create and like messaging and all that. So you can just click on create post. You. The 1st thing you have to choose is a community that you want to post in. So if suppose. I am. okay, let's let's just actually go to one of the communities. I am a part of which is let's say. let's just say the university's subreddit. So I have to select that I want to post something in the university's subreddit. Then I can add a title to my post, I can add a body to my post. This body is like a markdown editor, so you can use like a skip sequences, and you can have headings, and like h. 1 to H. 4, you can have paragraph lines. You can have everything you have in Markdown. You can also add images. You can add video, you can add links. You can add polls. basically many ways to interact using a post. So once you're done with all that, you can add tags to your post, so some subreddits make it mandatory to add tags. So I like suppose I'm posting on a like a vet subreddit like asking questions about. If you have animals at home like you have to tag the post with what kind of animal you have so vets? Who are on that subreddit will kind of filter out. So if there, if like, there are only doctors for dogs, they'll filter out only the dog posts, and they'll only interact with those posts. So that's where tags are useful. So yeah, so that's mostly my process or anyone's process that they go through to create a post commenting is pretty simple, like, you just go to any post that you want to interact with. You press on comment, and you can either create a new comment, or you can reply to a thread of comments so that that thread is like you can. There are like different stacks of comments under each other. So any thread you go to you can reply under that.

Right? So I'd say entertainment is subjective, but it also it always comes down to those 2 posts where either you're posting something for others to draw insights from, or others to draw conclusions from. Or it's just putting information out there. It can be anything. It can be like your experience using using a new phone, or you are writing a new story about some after who like recently passed away, or something like that. The common trend in those posts is you sharing information that others can absorb. So it all ties down to passive posts, whereas active posts are. You're asking people for advice straight up. So like, Hey, I am facing this problem with my code. Can you please help me? So people will comment on that. So I think there are different genres, of course. Sure, like there are entertainment, and there's news and all. But again, it just boils down to whether are you sharing information, or are you looking for interaction to gain insights from them. So yeah. and boils down to 2 posts.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "24", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "That that makes sense.

If I am, then I don't have a time preference. It's I'm I'm on the app whenever I want to. If I'm not, then it's usually when I have like some downtime like maybe when I'm eating lunch, or if I'm on the bus, or something like that, where I don't have anything to do, I might just open reddit and scroll to see something interesting. So that is my, that's the time I use reddit Also the time duration for which I use it varies so sometimes you could be using it for one question, and that one question could lead to like many other questions. So before you know it, you spent like 2\u00c2\u00a0h on it, like just like going down some rabbit hole. But If I'm just doing it on the bus or while eating, it's normally restricted to that activity.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "26", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "All right. and coming to obstacles like.

No. but on the mobile platform there are quite a few barriers. So the for one. The mobile platform is quite slow and clunky, like the Ui. Is not very intuitive. I'm not sure how they like. I'm not sure if it's different on other phones. But I use an android phone and it's very unintuitive and very heavyweight. So if I want to give you some examples like when you're creating a post, and you leave it in the middle. you can't save it as a draft which you can do on desktop. So that is something that is frustrating. If I want to post on Mobile Another thing is. you cannot keep track of comments intuitively on Mobile, so on desktop. You have like threads where you can easily see, but on Mobile you have. You also have threads, but I feel that the desktop version is much more clearly put out. So I would say, user experience ui ux is one frustration that I have on the mobile app.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "28", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Okay?

Do you encounter low quality or misleading posts?", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "29", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Yeah, so there are. So there are some subreddits which are very well moderated. So you have a lot of bots like auto moderators. So they fact check your posts, and they alert the human moderators if they feel that a post is not correctly, not entirely factual. so if if a community doesn't have auto moderators, it definitely like for a community community to exist, it has to have a moderator. And that moderator keeps track of any low quality or low effort posts. So I feel that if a community has a strong, a strong set of moderators, then the posts themselves are reliable. of course, anything you find on the Internet is not 100% reliable. But I feel that since there is a human element involved in moderating a community. It's more reliable than other stuff you can find on the Internet.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "30", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Okay?

So like, there's 1 subreddit just called news, which is just international news. There are also subreddits for like specific country news. I follow India news. But I don't really like, I don't really interact with any posts on India. News I just occasionally see it from time to time. But that being said, like Reddit, is not my primary source of news. I have other apps that I use to do that. there could I could use like subreddits of popular news channels. I am pretty sure they? They might also be posting on Reddit. But I just find it more convenient to keep news out of Reddit, because it's more of a it's more to satisfy curiosity, and not for news. no, no, not really for news. So news. I don't follow on on Reddit. That much current events. Yes, that also is very genre, specific. So if there is a current event that is related to a subreddit that you follow, then you will come across it. But other than that, unless it's something like Nobel Prize or some worldwide event like the Olympics, I'm pretty sure you won't hear of it on Reddit unless you're previously searching for it. Like if we, if it's a worldwide event, then there are some posts that will show up in like popular like there is a popular page that Reddit has where it. It shows you most of the posts that people are interacting with. So if there's something as big as Olympics or a Nobel Prize. It will show up there.

I use reddit all the time, for. So I have a laptop that I bought in February this year, which I researched a lot on Reddit. So the one thing that I like about Reddit is that if you go on Amazon, there are mostly good reviews about something Reddit is more of a balanced perspective, and you can also find people from varied backgrounds talking about the product. So say that I was trying to buy a laptop and someone who's into video editing has their opinion on the laptop and so if I was buying the laptop for video editing, I'd have a very. I'd have a much better idea about how about what to expect. So that's that's how Reddit is useful in that scenario.

So I have used that a couple of times for some health issues. But I would say, it's not the best place to ask about specific problems. It's more about learning about general things. I would say so if I was trying to incorporate like a new let's say I was trying to like, do Yoga? Or something like that? So that comes on the health right? So I can search for like, what are the best beginner, Yoga routines or something like that. So I'd say it's good for general health, related questions. But for specifics I've not used it, nor do I suggest anyone to use it. But yeah, it's up to your discretion like you can get a lot of good advice.

It will still allow you to open the app. It'll still allow you to view posts like view comments, view pictures on the app I'm sorry. Not on the app, but on your feed. But it won't allow you to make new posts, nor will it refresh the feed so you can use it offline. But I'd say, after you exhaust like, after you're done using that part of it like, after you're done interacting with all the posts, you can't really use it further. Yeah.

So you can have like card view or compact view. So card view is like I I would say. It's kind of like Instagram where one post at a time comes on your screen like like not exactly one post, but not more than 2 posts at once. And you can keep scrolling down like that versus the compact view where there are like 7 to 8 posts on your screen at once, and the post body is quite small, so you have to click on each post to read it. So I'd say that. It depends on what you're using it for. So again, when I said that, I'm just using it as a passive activity, I prefer, like card mode where I can just scroll through posts. If I'm using it actively, searching for something I prefer, like compact mode where I can see all relevant search results.

They are like, they run Google ads, so it it's kind of related to, I mean, any website that runs ads will have the same ads, I think, targeted ads towards you. So the experience doesn't really get ruined because of ad, because it's very subtle. To be honest, I am using an ad block on my browser. So maybe that's why I don't see any ads. But I'm still pretty certain that the the even before I used ad blocks ad block. The ads are quite subtle like, it doesn't interfere with your post experience or your reading experience. But when you're on the home screen, yes, do you do see ads? But they're always in one location, so you don't accidentally click on them. And you kind of learn to work your way around the ad. Also, there are not many ads on the screen. There's only one at any given time, so I feel it doesn't ruin the experience.

You also have, like a legacy Reddit. Where there are no animations, there are no rounded corners for columns. There are no like separating lines between posts, nothing of that sort. So it's it's a very fast website the legacy reddit. But from a user experience point of view, I think the current Reddit is better.

But there's nothing really that like I would say, hindering is the subreddit search. So the ability to find a subreddit is quite complicated at this point, because anyone can create a subreddit about anything, and they don't check if there is a separate existing subreddit. So when you want to find out when you want to find a subreddit, you have to do the searching. I think a feature that would improve the user experience would be where you just type in like a Gen.

And on the way I came across 0 Dha through Google and 0, Dha has their own sort of academy in which they have kind of a they have a web interface, and on which you can try to understand what what are the terminology is used in finance? What is the what is the literacy that you need to understand before delving into the world of finance and talk exchanges. And how does this whole world work? So that is where I came to understand everything about it, and since I was using 0 Dha's own learning platform to understand it I figured I should use Ruda's own platform to go into stock exchanges. and that is where I came across Stock Exchange per se. and for cryptocurrency it happened a little later, like 6 months later, as I was still studying on the all of this stuff. and I came to understand how crypto works also, and that is, when I tried to install different applications that provide an interface for cryptocurrency exchanges.

So yeah. but yeah, these 3 apps I was using initially. And I I found binance to be the best amongst them. The reason I found binance to be the best was They had a very seamless interface to do the exchange given. That cryptocurrency has a lot of legal regulations and restrictions when it comes to doing an exchange. Even now we are not able to do it very smoothly, because of all those regulations. But binance came up with very smooth ways to under all of that, and still be able to perform a trade in the least amount of time with the least amount of effort the other apps also did that. But I think Coinbase at that point of time was only focusing much on Us. Customers, and for Indian customers that were not so easy to perform a trade, while Busyrex did not have a very good platform to perform trades. To begin with, it was very tough to integrate your own bank account with Wazirex's account.

Maybe let's say Coinbase could have done that would have made you more interested or kind of given a competition to. The other one.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "18", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Basically, what coinbase could have done. I think. If you're generally so I would, I would segment this into 2 parts. So basically coinbase at that point of time, I think, was focusing only on us customers, because I am not completely sure this is an assumption I'm making, because at that point of time Coinbase was the primary choice people used to look for in the Us. To do A to perform a cryptocurrency trade. and I had actually got the recommendation for coinbase from a Youtube channel owned by a person in the Us. And they had showed me some features on the video which I wasn't able to see in the app that I had downloaded in India. So I figured they are doing something, especially for the Us. People which I am not able to access. So I I think if you are talking about the Indian market at that point of time, if Coinbase would have, you know, gotten deeper into the regulations that are present for. or cryptocurrency exchanges in India. it would have been helpful for tapping into the Indian market. They, if they had a seamless interface to integrate our bank accounts with coinbase at that point of time, or even some kind of a payment interface to get my cryptocurrencies into cash or cash to cryptocurrency conversions, because that is one thing I was not able to do. I was not able to get my cash from my bank to oh. a coin that I wanted to invest in. I wasn't able to do that at at the 1st place in Coinbase.

So for the next part, I know you said that right now you can't do stock trading since you're in the United States. But let's just take to take us back to a time where you were in India. What kinds of transactions do you usually make? So, for example, do you mostly buy and sell crypto? Or are you more focused on stock trades.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "20", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Okay, that's a good question. so initially, it was mostly stock trading. I so and in the beginning, when I just when I just started this out I was just playing around with this stuff. I was not making very heavy investments. It was just like it investments of a few \u00e2\u201a\u00b91,000 2, 2, 3,000 at Max. And I was just trying to look at a look and feel of how this works. and what kind of things propagate profits, what kind of things propagate loss? What are the different kinds of things I can do here? I was just trying to play around with them. I did that for about a month, and then after that, I started seriously trading and when I say trading, I mean long term investments, mostly not intraday trading So I used to. Every day I I used to keep a track of whatever I have invested whatever, how the market has moved. I used to keep a track of which particular stocks are performing well, which which of them are not performing good. And then based on that, I used to take decisions on a monthly basis, or like a fortnightly basis to realign. Where do I want to invest. So that is how I used to do my trading. But that was my pattern of trading back in India. Oh. later, at a point of time, I also started doing cryptocurrency trades. I have been averse to doing cryptocurrency trades compared to stock stock trades, because. 1st of all, the market is very, very volatile for cryptocurrencies, then. Stocks, Indian stocks, Indian equity. and sometimes there are scam coins that just come up in cryptocurrency. So I I was a very averse person from that kind of an aspect also. but I did used to invest in blue chip coins that you you can call them blue chip coins, the ones that are very popular, like bitcoin, ethereum, polygon, and stuff. So I did use to continually invest in them, because they are relatively safe investments. And yeah, but the amount of investment that I did in stock was definitely much, much higher than the amount of investments that I did in cryptocurrencies. So, yeah.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "21", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Understood. Thank you so much for elaborating you mentioned that you make a decision at the end of the month. Based on how the market has been. So could you walk me through? How that decision making process goes through generally.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "22", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Okay, so yeah, so there are a couple of factors that I like, look out for when I'm making a decision. 1st of all. what kind of an investment have I made? So there are. There can be. There is a 1 kind of segmentation called a small cap, mid cap and large cap, stocks. Small cap. Stocks are generally those which which which are available to you, you can. You can invest in them, but they are smaller companies per se. They, these companies. a less number of people have invested in them. If this company does good, then you can get a large amount of profits, but if it does bad, all of your profits can go away, so there is a high risk attached to them. Then there are mid cap stocks in which the amount of risk that you are taking is a little less. There are a little larger number of people that have invested in this, so your risk is shared and they are. The the stock is a little more liquid by liquid. What I mean is, you can sell it, or you can buy it easily, much easier than a small cap stock. and then there are large cap stocks which in which they are generally very safe to invest in. They are, mostly. They mostly have a result of an in profit. Increased profit for you. So keeping the these things in mind, I see how they have performed in the past 3 months. How has their performance been so? If it, if it is a small cap stock, and in the past 3 months. If they have not performed well, even if they have gone a bit down, I would still be fine with it, because I am taking a risk here, and if I have a positive outlook for this particular stock, saying that even if it is down right now, I feel that it is down because people have not seen the potential in it, and they will see the potential in the next few months or so. I would keep a bet on it. but for a large cap stock, if I try to see like how they have done it. and if they have not really performed well in the past 6 months. It is an indicator that a lot of people who have invested there are pulling out. And that shows that maybe some of these people have some insights into into the company that I don't have, because there are. There are so many people investing into it. So it at this point of time I would be inclined to get my stocks out of here. So that that is one kind of decision, then another kind of decision that I take is based on profits. So if I feel that I have maximized the amount of profit that I have to take from this particular transaction or trade, I would buy out my profits and sell the stock. And yeah, that would be another kind of decision that I would take. So, yeah, these are the different kinds of decisions.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "23", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Understood that was really comprehensive. Thank you so much.

What you're saying is correct, and they integrate the account with your bank account, and you are able to make exchanges. And then if once you are able to do that I think I am. Now you're if you are able to make trades easily. When I say trades easily, it means that I'm able to understand how the how a particular stock is moving at that point of time, and I'm able to make a trade instantly, or I'm able to set up rules of for trading.

And yeah, so that that is once a day, and once in 2 weeks or so I will open it for some time to refactor my investments. As I said before I try to. I try to look what decisions I have to make and try to refactor. Where do I need to sell? Where do I need to buy more and stuff that that I do once in 2 weeks or once in a month.

I will have 2 ways either to fill the form inside the website, and I never know when they will respond to me and how efficient is this process. or just to take their location from the map, then try to find more about them, using other websites like Google Map, where I might find a phone number or an email where I can communicate directly.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "30", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Got it.

Right? When you visit visit a website for the 1st time, you might have visited multiple websites.

One of the things that I like is that they provide sometimes a map with a drawing tool where you can just draw a circle around the place you're interested in in the map, and they will select the search inside that area because sometimes searching by the neighborhood name will be very specific, like, if there is a very good option just 2 meters away, it will not be considered so by drawing. You can like, have more flexibility on selecting the area. Also, another thing that I like is providing reviews, I think reviews from people, makes. makes places feel more trusted, and could help let you have all the information together. one of the things that I don't like is actually these extra steps like requiring you to register in the website. And then you have, like, multiple, unknown, like multiple buttons that you don't know. What would they proceed you to?

Also there is a button called Request a tour, and also it will have this form that you should fill, which is exactly when you were interested in the property. So it feels like it feels like weird.

You can filter by price range. you can filter by the number of beds and baths you can also filter by the home type whether you want a house, an apartment. and also you can filter by extra criteria, like the move-in date, or any other things that you want, like allowing pets, for example, having utilities, and so on.

What if I filter by some criteria, and then I lost all the options where the owners didn't specify. For example, maybe the owner can allow pets, but he didn't try that explicitly in the profile. So when I just filtered by allowing a pet, they will just show for me the ones that has confirmed. So maybe I would love if there is an option where I can have like. I can also allow the people who didn't specify, so I can see both with with like.

Well, moving forward a little bit more. I'd love to hear a little bit more about the use case in shopping in our discussion and some of the documents I've been reading. It sounds like Instagram is like the primary source for your shopping. Is that correct?", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "10", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Yeah. And yes, you're right. So I use Instagram mainly to shop on days like Valentine's Day, for example. So I would go on Instagram to get my my girlfriend, maybe a cake from a really good spot or a a good So in Rwanda there is. There is this thing where you know, if you have a shop, you can actually more or less have it as a business account on Instagram, where you post like the products you make. So essentially, most of the things are like. They go from cakes to dresses to drawers, you know you can. And the list continues. So I try to spot like you know, accounts that I've mostly like cakes, because I know my girlfriend likes like eating cakes a lot. So I try to go. And then, you know, get like really good cakes. And and I and I order from there. But that's really been the main main way in which I purchase stuff on Instagram, because then I would go and see the the contact of the shop, and then I would use that now to reach out to them, either like to a landline or or, you know, using Whatsapp in. In other cases, I've used Whatsapp. Maybe if I if I'm looking to maybe purchase address. I would I could go to an account of a vendor who, you know, is who is showcasing this plot, and, you know, see the designs they have in store. and and I'll go to an actual market and ask for those. These designs I would have seen like online.

Is there some type of feature that facilitates that for you.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "12", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Yeah, I see. I think there is a there's this search bar on. So when you once you open is the Instagram especially the Instagram web on the left panel. You have, you know, like your profile, you have, like a lot of other things there. But then, when you go on the top right, you have a part where you can do like a search, and there you can now enter the name of of what you want to look for. So in my case, I would be like cakes. and it's really good, because what happens is, I don't know if this is a feature that is really integrated in the system is it will search for like cake vendors in the area you are in right. So like right now, I'm sure if I went to search for cakes in the Us. I would see like people who are doing cakes like just around me. So I found that really useful. and if I don't see immediately what I'm looking for, I'll just add maybe the name of the location. Maybe cakes in Rwanda or cake sellers in wonder. Or you know those those kind of terms, and and it can easily pull that kind of information. for me. Yeah.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "13", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Awesome.

It shows you, does it show you products, or does it show you vendors.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "14", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "It. It shows me it would show me the accounts. Yeah. And you're right. They they actually like vendors, but, unlike, you know, platforms like Amazon, where. you know, you don't really need to have any physical contact with the with with a vendor. Right? What I mean is, if you, if if let's say I was to use Amazon because I've used Amazon sometimes as well, but not as often as Instagram. you you just go and see the product you swipe your card and you purchase, and it gets delivered to you. Now with this one, even though you've seen the product. What happens is you need to still get in touch with the vendor right? to get the the product sent to you. So I think that that use case. I'm sure it's definitely good that way, especially like my side of the world where in in some cases people. And and this has happened to me once I actually saw some products like Louis flowers and cakes. I wanted to buy, you know, but it it appears that this Instagram account was actually a malicious account. And so what will happen is, they will tell you to send the money. and when you send that money you will not get the product delivered to you right, and you've lost the money, and there is no way you can track who has this account, you know, even if they're in Rwanda. Rwanda is a very big country, so that happened to me once. I didn't lose my money, because maybe I was very wise to understand that. You know you have to deliver before I pay you. Right.

And then in the account, bio, that that is where I would see, like, maybe their phone number and their and and their contact information. If it's a business account you can actually reach out to them, they will tell you if they if they are reachable on Whatsapp or through normal call, and then you can. You can just reach out to to them. Usually the response time. If it's a if it's a very active account, is not that it's it's actually quick. There is low latency. Another thing is, you can also reach out on the app itself. You can. You can do a Instagram chat to that number, and then they will get back to you right, but I would. I would always prefer to, you know, reach out to the number they've specified, because that way the communication is quicker.

Are there any other features that may help you in cases where you don't necessarily know what specific gift you want to get. So I'm 1 personal example I can give is if I go to a physical store. and it's Valentine's day.

I I just go, and I would, you know, shuffle through like a bunch of images and a bunch of products they have. and I might end up picking something that you know I not imagine I'll pick like when when I was, you know, going to the platform. So I think in that way it's a good way, you know, to see, like what is available, and see what you might, you might, you know, choose in the moment of things as opposed to, you know, having something planned and then going to buy it. So that gives you some kind of flexibility in your choices. And I think it's it's also something I like about it.

So the time I opened the app, and one of the things that I did not feel to mention is one of the things I do not like with Instagram is for me to use the application right I have to sign in. so I would have loved to use the application without signing in right, but I but each time I have to use it I have to sign it. and that takes time. and some. Sometimes I don't want someone to know online. I just want to go and search for what I'm searching for. I get it. And I'm and I'm out of it right? So we that is one thing I don't like. Okay. But now, moving forward. let's say I have signed in. I've gone to the search bar, and I've searched for you know the vendor I want to get the kicks from. Oh, flowers form I I would automatically. It's gonna save my search results right in a dropdown. So if I come back to Instagram, maybe after one month it will show me the vendor I, you know, searched for like one month prior right, which is also a good feature, because then I don't have to. Always, you know, search for vendors. I can just pick one I used in the past. Now the next thing I go and I go to their page, their page would have their bio, and you would have a section where you have highlights. Maybe they were. They are posting about you know, events they have created with their products and things like that. And then there's a part where you have, like a gallery of of those images. The good with the gallery is that when you go to the gallery you have people commenting, and you also have likes. This is a really good feature. Because if you see engagement, then you'd actually know that actually, people are using this site. People love their products, and and people would would like to recommend people to use it as well. That that was, that was, I think, an important feature. I that helped me to spot that you know. The the other account I I just mentioned to you was a malicious account. because you expect that if an account, you know, has been there for a long time, and they have, let's say, a list of a thousand products, then the products right at the bottom should have more likes. you know. But then, if you are seeing just one like and maybe 0 comments, then it just means that this person came one day and then uploaded all the images and left right for someone to fall on them. So that feature really, really, it's It's good.

I think this is a good question. Yes, definitely I could search for. Let's say, if I knew your name, John Mc. Right. I could search for you to on the on the on the app. but, like you said, you're not on the app, so I will not find you right. So if if I you could, it's a good way to connect with people to share, you know, photos of yourself and the things you are doing, and all of those stuff that you know people like to do. But I tend to to to. How can I say I tend to be careful with that aspect of you know, posting about your life and your stuff on social media. Because, it's it's just it could come back, you know, to hurt you or hunt you in the future. Right? So I try to. If if I am to do that, then I make sure I have a private account, because my account currently is private. So only very close friends of me. You know I use friends to me, and I can see my post. So if I post something, if someone in the public will not have access to it, which is good, and if I'm online, I would expect that just my very close friends would see I'm online. So it kind of helps to weed away the the the evils of you know, people preying on your life and on social media and all of that stuff. So yeah, it's a. It's a good way to connect with people. Yes, but it also has its downside, especially if you. You're very open and outlandish about how you live your life and what you do. which which I just find to be unnecessary. Yeah. in my opinion.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "27", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Awesome to clarify on that. So it sounds like this. App also has a social component. Apart from the sale portion of the app.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "28", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Yes, it does.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "29", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Is there any separation between these 2? Can you maybe explain a little bit on the difference between this connection being able to to write posts about yourself, and then the the buying portion.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "30", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Okay. So with the connection with it's more of I would think of. And if you're familiar with Facebook. it's, it's it's like Facebook in in the sense that you could go. And let's say, after this call, I really really you know, enjoyed our conversation, which I do, by the way, and I would like to connect more with you and I, and I think I would love to know you more, and maybe as a friend, you know I would, and you are on Instagram. I would go to follow you on Instagram. What what that does with me is, if any time in in this life. I lose your phone number or your immediate contact or your email address. We are still friends on Instagram, so I could always lodge back there and get to you. So that to me is a is a really good benefit for me, because I've traveled across like You know different countries now, and I keep changing my phone numbers. So so if if I if we were friends and you're we are friends on Instagram, I can always, you know, reconnect with you by getting in touch with you, using using the application. So to me, I find that component really helpful as well to connect with people here.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "31", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "I see. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Thank you for that. It sounds like we could also delve completely into that as a separate subject. Other portion of the app that itself entails quite a bit. I think, for for brevity. I think we'll mostly focus on the the shopping portion of this app, but I think that that's a very important aspect. I'm sure that plays a big role. Have you ever found that the connection side of the app has also crossed over into you. being able to to purchase something more easily, like maybe an acquaintance. but has, like recommended something along those lines.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "32", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Yeah, yeah, true. Yeah, I think it. It would really go more towards like the clothing. So for me, I like to dress in a particular way that I find I would say, I like to dress like cool. So what happens is, if I see maybe something someone wears, and it really looks good on them. It would. If if I go to the market to buy stuff and I see that it will, it will kind of play a role in me, actually acquiring it, you know, in in a way. So in that regard, I think it's it's more of, I would say an enabler in you purchasing particular product. whether you, whether it is consciously or unconsciously, it has that effect. Right so, and again, that is one of the reasons why I try to stay away from it a lot, because this is this is the clothing aspect of it, and we don't. I mean, I don't know the other things that it could affect me. I'm sorry it could make me do unconsciously, unconsciously. So I try to stay away from it when I'm when I'm not having any use for it, and only use it when I have, you know, a need for it. Yeah.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "33", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "So thank you for that. Just making a quick note of that real, quick. great. awesome Are there any other features you you maybe mentioned that it can kind of like hook you when you're using the app. Are there any other features within the app that make that very prevalent?

I'm I'm wondering what are the the strongest features that make the app so addictive.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "34", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "This cooling feature is one of them that I can remember. because it has an infinity school where it just keeps on updating content as you scroll down of your friends, of public or people you follow, and all of that. That is one the second one would be the fact that you know you wanna catch up with where people are. It's a feature that can be addictive. So what I mean by this is. if let's say you're someone who tends to more or less like follow the trend. What happens is you always want to catch up with where everyone is and what they are up to, and what they are doing, what they are buying into, and you know, and what they are doing with their lives at this point in time, and and that takes a lot of time, because you might see one picture that might, you know, say, you should look at another picture, and maybe look at an event and look at another thing. So those things make it kind of addictive and very time consuming. Yeah.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "35", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "I see. and maybe we could clarify some of the vocabulary there.

So what happens is. if if I follow you. you can follow me back, and we become friends now for people like let's say. if I were to follow someone like Barack Obama he might not know that I'm following him, because his account might be a a celebrity account or a star account, so to to say. And what would end up happening is. I would just be a follower of him, and you know every content he posts I can see. But I am. I'm irrelevant, or my content is irrelevant to him, because he will never show up in his feed. Right? That that is, one that that is one thing, the other. The other aspect is. you could also more or less follow like groups or hashtags. and that also every content that anyone posts there you would also be able to see it, you know. So those are the various ways in which you can follow people. You can follow groups, and you can follow like star people like people who have made a name of themselves, but then you're following them makes you irrelevant again, because they will never see anything about you. Show up in their feeds. You would probably be following them for the advice and lessons about life, which again, I find to be irrelevant. Yeah.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "37", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "If I understand what you were saying correctly.

Well, actually, I haven't really used groups. But I know there was. There's a group feature in Facebook. And since Facebook runs like Instagram. It. It's it's kind of imperative that they brought those features as well to Instagram. I know I used to be in groups when I used Facebook. But it's been a really long time ago groups on Instagram I haven't used, but I know their hashtags whereby if you subscribe to a hashtag which is more or less like a group. What happens is, if anybody ever posts anything on Instagram, and you know, calls that hashtag, or just, you know, puts that hashtag on the post. It's gonna show up on your in your feed, right? So That is one way in which I would say. I have seen how groups have been used on Instagram. But it's not the same way. It's not the same thing, I would say, for how groups are.

I think we kind of got a little bit onto like the other aspect of maybe the social media one you kind of mentioned how social media aspect does influence the purchasing things like, if you see someone wearing something very nice? It might spur you to maybe look up something similar. Are there any features or other obstacles you maybe mentioned one obstacle you faced was malicious people, or needing to sign in.

Right? So once I once I see what I want, or or I do what I want with the app. I just I just kinda lock out myself and then delete the application on my phone. or if it's if it's on the web, I would just kind of kind of delete the history of it, or there's a feature there. I just do that, so that I don't have to, you know, access it easily. and I only access it when I need something. So for me, the fact that I cannot access my. I cannot access anything in the app. If I've not logged in. even if it's to view the profile of the vendor. it's a bit disturbing. I would. I would have hoped that. You know I could do things without needing to log in But this is the main obstacle. How I've how I've gone about that is just, you know, trying to use it. Like, if I plan to use it. During Valentine's I would start looking at stuff like few days towards that time, and just leave the leave my like. Not log out myself. Just leave myself to be, you know. locked in. and once that period, you know, elapses. I can. And I've I've gotten what I want. I can log out from it. you know.

So for me, actually. it's not that I choose Instagram. I think in some ways. what happened was when I because I've traveled a lot. I've moved from Cameroon to Ghana and to Germany, to Rwanda. Now I'm in the Us. For example, what ends up happening is when you go to a new place. You don't really know, like the vendors there, you don't know what they have to offer. and so an app like Instagram, with these accounts on them. would quickly, you know, help you to see where vendors are, cause their bios. You also have their location. which number to call which products they have. That is very, very helpful information. And for someone like me, who is probably in a place for a very short time, right? And and I think that is how useful, I would say Instagram has has been for me in terms of purchasing stuff. But but apart from that I I would not really say I choose it like over something else.

What you put there is. They don't put the price of the products. They just show you what the products are. But I I would imagine that if they did that, then maybe people would not ask about the products, and so they will not get the feedback they need on pricing. And so once I find out, figure out the price of the product. I would go ahead to ask for the phone number I can use for the payment. And I once I conduct that payment. I would confirm my address where the whatever I'm buying, you know, should be delivered to. And then I basically just wait. Once the product comes, or is it or is about to be dispatched? They'll give me a phone call. Tell me, you know they are about to reach my my home, or they are at my home. I should come pick it up so.

So it sounds like you travel around a lot. So there are a lot of times where you want to be able to shop locally around, find specific items that you're looking for, and you use Instagram. which provides this feature to help you find stores in your immediate location. In addition to that, it also provides search functionality. So if you have some type of occasion or a specific thing that you want to purchase, you're able to search through it and find relevant stores and vendors.

So for example, if you have a hundred products and we just uploaded 2 products today. I would not expect 2 products today to have as many likes as products you uploaded 6 months ago. Right? The the products you uploaded 6 months ago would probably have more likes and more engagement than the 2 products you just uploaded today. However, if I go to your gallery, and I realize that your products more or less have similar likes and similar comments. It. It is fishy. It looks like it's a malicious site or a malicious account, and you're just trying to see who you can bait to pay, and then they never get the product they want. So in that way, it helps me. And this is probably just social engineering. It just helps me to know which accounts are probably good and which ones are not good I should buy from, and I should not buy from. Yeah.

How do these purpose help you achieve your specific goals?", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "7", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "So I prefer using slack because it's instant communication with anyone I wish to talk to within the university. An advantage I feel within slack that you don't have in other applications is I don't need to like save anybody's information. I don't need to like, save their numbers, save their email. I if I know their name, or sometimes even their last name, I can look them up, and I can reach out to them almost immediately. And I can do it over my phone. I can do it if my laptop's open and I definitely enjoy that aspect, yeah,", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "8", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "yeah.

So besides communicating with some anyone in the university instantly, I also like the channel feature within slack, where I can reach a wide audience immediately.

Another thing that I like about the channel feature is that when I join a channel, I have the history of that channel at my fingertips, like so I have access to information that was there before I even joined the channel, and I felt that was a pretty good advantage over other apps and so and at any given point, it's good to know what people are talking about, what everyone's sharing, be it with respect to a particular subject, or could just be in general, like the MSC channel for software engineering, I like to hear what's happening around within the department, within the program, what's happening around campus.

I can send you emojis. I can format the text, whatever, any way I want. And at the bottom, there is an option to attach a document, and I can attach any type of file I want.

So I would search for something that the professor said, using the keyword over there, and it would display a list of you know matches a problem that I encountered is again, coming back to the slack, showing me everything from a channel that you know before I even joined. So because there's so much information out there, sometimes when I search for a keyword or keywords, I get way too much information in the search results.

I 1st learned how to code since grade 10. But I really started practicing coding questions in grade 11 back then, because, I'm doing a computer contest for university applications. So if you have a good contact score, it really helps for university applications.

So like. all the companies take questions or variations of the questions from the leetcode, and it's the primary reason I use leetcode and one other benefits that we can discuss like the same question with my friend. For example, if I have if I find like, one problem is really difficult. And I want to discuss it. It's really easy for us to refer to the question. And we can do this to together. Yeah, for greeksForGreeks. I also use it, but I mainly use it to find find a like more explained solution because on the leetcode platform, like the solutions are told, and the descriptions are not really helpful, and it's not really intuitive, but on GrreksForGreeks.

So I use needcode for this purpose, and I use leetcode for other purpose. For example, I just want to try a random question to just test myself or I want to discover, like a new question, or to to see if there's a new algorithm that I haven't learned.

Because after you practice right before the interview, your your brain is more functioning and you can prepare better, and I find that if you have. if you you want to practice for that day you need to like allocate a good chunk of the time for you to sit down and go through the practice go through the problems like more patiently. And if you really like. You can't do this without patience. So you really need time within a day, so that you focus on on practicing questions, and you do. You cannot have like distraction.

So this this question is really depend on difficulty. So and it really depends on experience. For example, if I just a if I? If I just a new person using using this platform to practice coding questions. I might take like 20\u00c2\u00a0min to 30\u00c2\u00a0min for an easy question and 30\u00c2\u00a0min to an hour for a medium question. But after like, I practice for a long time for easy questions depending on the questions. I can just finish it in 5 to 10\u00c2\u00a0min for medium questions. depending on the question type. For example, I'm really good at arrays and trees. And for those questions I can finish like in 10 to 20\u00c2\u00a0min. But for hard questions again, it really depends on question type. If it's about some if it's a Dfs question or a priority queue question. or a Dp question, I I can do this depending on the question. I can do this from 30\u00c2\u00a0min to an hour, but I cannot guarantee that I can solve. I can solve this question like the most often way, and to pass all the test cases. But for other other type of questions, for example, monotonic, monotonic stack and some other algorithms that I'm not really familiar with it. then I cannot solve it. Basically like, no matter how much time I spend, like, I usually spend an hour. And then to conclude that no, I cannot do this on my own. So I will go look at the solutions and the solutions will typically help me to get understanding of how this question is supposed to be solved, and look at this like, and also take like an hour to really comprehend the solution, and try yourself. And even though, after you look at the solutions and practice the question, it's also really important to go back to this question some other time to make sure that you don't forget.

It depends like the time it it depends on the difficulty. So I just wanna clarify. I think you mentioned easy, medium and hard.

They are created by the platform. So they are created by the leetcode and leetcode will categorize, like each question into a easy medium or hard, and I usually use them to to know that if I want to practice them. For example, I usually practice medium hard questions and target like within, like 20 to 40\u00c2\u00a0min. But if I just want. If I see this question and see that, see that it is an easy question I would just allocate like, for example, like 10\u00c2\u00a0min to solve this question so like it does give me like a rough time on how much time I should spend on it. And if I spend more time than then, like this recommended time. Then I will. I will just try to practice more on this category of questions, so I can do better next time. And but this, like the difficulty level set by equal, it's not. It's not 100% correct. Some medium questions actually take long, like a longer time than harder questions depending on the edge cases. So some medium questions you have to really think through, like all the edge cases and add lots of if else. And that's sometimes it's more time consuming than hard questions.

So, for example, if I'm in a bad mood, I can just go to an easy question to feel good about myself. and I can practice hard questions when I really have the brain for it. Another feature I really like is that they link similar questions under each question. For example, if I go to a question and it's about arrays, and if I like, there's a button under the problem that lets you to jump to another similar question. So you can keep practicing the a.

So first, st I will just go to the code.com, and then I will click on the problems on on the tab, and then usually I click on the there's like all the categories, and then I can expand the list. And then, if I want to practice. For example, dynamic programming. I'll click on the list. And then there is like a list of dynamic programming questions, and then I will select the one that doesn't have a check mark. So all the check mark means that I have completed those questions before, so I will try to find one that I haven't complete to to practice it, and once I click the exact question, the question window will pop up and there will be 3 panels. The 1st panel is on the left, and which has the problem description the constraints. And yeah, yeah. And some some test cases that they provide on the right, on the second panel. There's like a editor that lets you to input your code, your solution. And on the last panel they provide the test cases, and you can customize the test cases, and there's like a submit button on the top. And you can also run your your code.

If I click submit right after that the platform doesn't allow me to do that, because it says like, you are submitting things too quickly, and you just. And you need to wait for a while to submit again. So I think that's really annoying for me. So that's really slows me down. And also I find that something that's also disturbing is that after I submit my code, I find that the performance is not always correct. For example, I tried to submit the same code I coded like 2 years ago, and then the performance, like degraded for some reason. But the code is exactly the same. So so that is also really disturbing.

So I really want it to add more tests like from the start. So we can code towards so we can infer what is missing from those test cases, and I also wanted to like. allow the allow other users to add their custom at their test cases to the existing test case, so we can use them as a reference on whether or not. We are on the right track when we are coding. So that's a feature. I think it's missing. I also wanted to provide, like approximately, how much time we would need to take to solve for solve a question. For example, I mentioned that I'm targeting 20 to 30\u00c2\u00a0min for a meeting question. But like I am. but that's just for me. I want to see, like what the legal people think, that how much time it should be on solving like, for example, this type of question, it's also helpful to to display, like the time for each question, so that we know that some medium questions should be solved quicker than the other meeting questions, or even more. Some meeting questions should to be solved quick to be solved longer than the some of the hard questions because of some edge cases.

So I think by practicing the questions from the wicked contest. It helps me to. It helps me to gain the reading skills, to transform, like a new set, a new set of questions and then transform it to something that I practiced before.

And yeah, and also, another important thing is that the just look at the solution when it takes you like hours to solve? Look at the question, and we have no idea of how to solve this, solve this problem. And because some some of the solution is just like you cannot think of the solution if you're not a genius. So do look at a solution. Don't think it's a bad thing to do like. Don't look at a solution when you 1st time seeing the question, but after you panic for like hours, you should look at the solution, because sometimes you just have to look at the solutions once and to do like these kind of problems.

So as I said before, sometimes during class, there are some terms or some examples you don't really understand. And the office hours are like, there's no available office hours today, and you have to wait till tomorrow, or even next week to answer those questions. But with chat gpt it can often explain those basic terms and stuff like very clearly. And you can ask it like at any time. So that's the reason why I use it for my study and then for the for the projects, I think sometimes my own. Mind is kind of limited. So basically using chat, Gpt is giving me more perspective perspectives from the other fuse like the ones I I can't really sort of by my own. So that's the reason why I'm using it for those 2 scenarios.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "10", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Got it.

You can get some reference from the books or papers online, and then you can check if that's correct, and for the computational ones, for example, if you want Chat Gpt, to calculate something for you. Basically, I think you should calculate those by yourself and then check if the result it provides you is correct. So that's very important, because chatgpt is not always correct. So yeah, sometimes it's hard to. If the if your question is like a very high level. Sometimes it's really hard for you to see chat, Gpt gets wrong.

So for my project. Usually I turn to a chat chat, gpt at the beginning. So as I said before, chat gpt is is better at creativity things. And it's very good at basic level stuff. It's correct most of the time. So when I want to start a project Chat Gpt can provide me with some ideas, and also, if I tell, Chat, gpt what what I'm planning to do often it can give me an outline about what you should do. And what are the points that are important? So basically with those points I can have a better idea of how I can. implement my project and get some like a different point of view for my project before starting, but during the like during in the middle of the project. I don't really like to use chat gpt, because when you are halfway done the project can be really complicated. And when you want to ask something to chat gpt, sometimes you have to provide the whole context to it. So chatgpt will always like miss some of the context, and it will not provide you with very accurate answers. So that's the reason why I usually use it at the beginning of the project, and also like at the beginning, it can provide me with some ideas, so I can refine my ideas before I start.

Like make, chat, gpt, understand my my context, and If chatgpt, misunderstand any of my message it can be it can provide me with. The answer. I'm not really expected. So after I after I have my questions I will click the send button and send my questions to chat, Gpt. and then Chatgpt will give me back its answer, and sometimes I will also attach some images and also some documents to chat. Gpt, so it's like, it's better illustration of my questions. So if I I'm only doing like plain text.

It's really helpful, like you can just click the history and see like what Chat Gpt told you before, and see its logic. It's if you use it for a study, some study the logics and terminologies for some new stuff.

So if you want sometimes, if you want to keep, follow up, and then they will tell you your usage, for this model is is like you've you've you've used all the chance like talking to this model today. So you have to wait till tomorrow, or like several days after today, to like keep using the model to ask the questions, but with the plus version you have unlimited access to those, or like more like. not unlimited, but, like you, you can ask more, follow up questions to the higher level model. So I think that's very useful when you really want to know something. And you really need the High level model to analyze it and reasoning about it like, more logically.

So that's 1 problem I've encountered before, and another one is like. I think, before they chat, Gpt was down for for a while, and people some people like rely on it to submit their work like, or to like trying to do something in a timely manner.

So I think it's pretty important to to increase the numbers, to make sure that I to to show people that I'm active on Linkedin. So one rate, one main reason for me to doing the connections on Linkedin, just just to encourage this number. And my sec second goal is to to get referrals from current employees for my 3rd company.

For example, if I want to ask for referral in company. I will like type my company and my university in the search bar to and then Kim will give me the list of people who has the same background is me like, who has, who is currently or previously a company employee. and also also was, or is, my university's student. and then I am going to click on, click into their profile and to see about their experience. If their experience are the exactly what I'm looking for. Then I'm going to hit the connect button and in Linkedin. There is an option that you can send a note to the your connection, potential connection. and I will usually like add a message to introduce myself and I maybe will also tell them like I want to. If they will like to refer me for the position. Yeah. And then after this, I will just like wait to see if they except my invitation to connect. and if they do, I can then start to chat with them for the further details. and if they're not, then linking will not show me, like any further other stuff.

So of the people shown the search result. Some people they were previous company employee. They are not current employees, so they are not able to refer me for the position. So this is like one thing I would not choose not to connect with these people. And Another thing is that sometimes the people in the search results. They only satisfy, like one of the one, or like none of the that the requirements I want. So that's also like what I will filter out for the potential connections. So yeah. So just for this example, I will. I will only choose people who is currently a company employee and who was my university's student. So I can.

So that's the reason for me to add the company name to the to the when I was doing the searching and the reason for me to add my university to the search. keywords is that, I think?

Is that so if you're a member, you are a linking premium user, then you are able to check like as many as result of. So when you're doing the searching for people. But if you are not, you're probably gonna able to access like a limited list of people. So, and in the worst case, like there are just like one or 2, or even none of the people in the search result.

Option is that to modify the keywords in my when I was doing the searching. so I may kind of like delete one or 2 of the keyword. or like to be more specific, so to see like, if Lincoln is giving me so like a more precise people with like a more precise background that I'm looking for.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "16", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "All right. and we're about to conclude the interview.

So normally, when I have. Let's say a lot of funds in my checking account, so I normally transfer it over to my savings, so I can get even that little bit of interest I normally get. So that's normally what I use the app itself for. right. But apart from that. there are obviously many services like payments like. So I use apple pay, and then using that any like target or something. So any grocery stores, or like any outlets. So I use apple pay there. So which directly connects to chase itself.

So everything is presented to me in in sort of like this dashboard when I sign in. So it shows me all my bank accounts. So right now I have a checking and a savings account shows me how much it shows me the balance in each of the accounts, and it also shows me my deposits and withdrawals.

I get a notification on my phone saying that this much amount of money has been spent, and then I can also contest it, which is great.

And as I scroll down, there's another section, for see all transactions. it gives me like a small like, I think, the previous 5 transactions. It shows me the previous 5 transactions, and then it gives me the option to see. Also, I'll just probably click that and then go with that. Yeah. So it shows me my current balance. It shows me my account and routing number if I click on another button. Right? And then yeah. So it, as I, as I mentioned before it shows me my balance. It shows me the deposits have done this month, and then all the withdrawals right? So as I scroll down I just see what how much is spent, and where. and at what time? And what is the balance at that point in time? Right? But apart from that, I don't really see it categorizing the thing except that it just categorizes how I spend it. Like it says, if it's card Zelle or yeah, if it's like another fee or something like that, or if it's like an account transfer. But apart from that, it doesn't have any other sort of indicator to show that I've let's say, spend it on groceries or on fuel, or something like that.

Lets me set up my debit card right as in like it sets me.

So I can go into that right now. It shows me my debit card coverage. It shows me all the transactions, as I mentioned before. Yeah. but I don't see like a separate column to like set limits my transaction, because the last time I used this was on the mobile app. Now, let's see. Okay, so there is a call option called more. If I click on more, then it it has a bunch of other stuff it has like drop down columns. That's a drop down list. and then there.

But I can go down and see setup overdraft services. So I believe there's a debit card coverage I don't think that's what that's what we're looking for. Let me just go back and check again. Yeah, so obviously, it's not very intuitive. I would really like it to be a bit more better. though. Yeah. So obviously, okay, overdraft protections. All, there is something called overdraft protection. But then that is not what we're looking for.

So even if let's say that limit really matters to me, I can't really go above it, because most of my funds are in savings, anyway. Right? But obviously like at 1 point in time, I would like to use it at some point, because I remember using it for my previous credit and debit cards. So yeah.

It's showing me 3 type of transfer, a way to transfer at least so one is scheduled transferred. So I can basically transfer from this account to another account. So the only option I'm getting there is my savings account, because I don't think I've added another account to send to this. So there is a link to an external account. So I'll go. I'll come back to that. There's also transfer activity and external accounts. So I believe external accounts is to basically track fair, like basically to add accounts from for other people, right? So looks like I don't have chase accounts, but I'll see if I can sell. I don't think Zelle is I don't think we can sell on of the web app. so I will. Yeah.

There is a option for transfer from, so I will choose my checking account and transfer to. I will choose my settings account right? So then it tells me how much amount I'm supposed how much amount I I wanna transfer. So let's say, I put $1 right. And it says, transfer date. So I'm assuming that's the date I want to schedule the transfer, for I'll keep it for today itself, so that, you know it gets done quickly. And there's also notice self. So just to keep note of what this transfer exactly is, for there's also an option for setup, repeated transfers. That's that I'm assuming is for like stuff like rent or utilities. I'll just see what that does. So if I turn it on. it lets me select the frequency tells, lets me select. When do I have to send it in that one? So if I select monthly, then it lets me select what date I want to send it on. But if I if I select, let's say weekly, then it lets me select what day I want to send it on what like? What day of the week I want to send it. If that makes sense right, and it also lets me select the 1st transfer date, and it tells me if I want to ending date, or if I want, like a number of transfers that I want to send, but for now I'll just turn it off because I don't think that really it in the scope of this question. So yeah. So once I've entered all the details. I can just click on next date. So then it tells me it asks me if everything looks okay. So just to confirm which is a great detail. so it tells me that the amount I'm sending is one. The transfer date is 31st of October, which is the 30th of October. I'm sorry now and then. Notice, self is none right? So alright. So basically, once I click transfer money, it should be that. Yeah. So it's scheduled to transfer of one dollars to my savings account now. I believe, due to banking hours. It it'll send it on 31st of October. So. Yeah, so, but it has been scheduled.

Then it's great, because, like, it's super intuitive, and then it makes sure that you don't send the wrong amount, or like to the wrong person. So that is great, and then it lets you schedule properly. It also lets you repeat the transactions is a great, so you don't have to come and keep on doing it again and again. Yeah.

It has card services, like replacing a lock, replacing a card, like adding, locking or unlocking a card and all that, and then it also has claims and disputes like fraud and according profile and more sources. So if if what we're looking for doesn't really match with any of these also have options like schedule, a meeting to send a message. find a local branch or call, but I don't see like a way to like text or like chat with a with a bank manager like someone in the bank, like on through text through the website.

But obviously, I believe there are like a few limitations as to why they can't add it. But that obviously, that'd be a great feature like either. Let's say, through an AI bot. Obviously, people are more well versed with technology will will just be able to click on links and then get it done.

I I think I had to click like 7 or 8 times to even get to locking or unlocking my debit card, which is. which is honestly kind of bad design.

Which can include some you know, behind the scenes stuff, or early access to episodes.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "30", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "See. So that's a very good balance you have for that, and you have thought I am pretty sure you would have thought a lot on deciding that. So yeah, so like, like, also like, could you then describe, like the main actions you take to curate and recommend podcast for the like spotify listeners like, you know, you are getting a new user or the long term user. How do you still recommend podcast for them?", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "31", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Oh, great. Okay, so this is where we'll get into the nitty gritties of some technical stuff, I guess. So. Yeah, main of our actions includes. You know, developing AI driven recommendation engines. So utilizing kind of the semantic memory and you know what sort of podcast users most like to listen to to match them with similar preferences. Implementing user preference settings is another thing that we adopt. So we allow users to set their interests as well. Throughout their journey. And we try and leverage our social sharing. So we try and integrate a social media of to basically enhance recommendations based on the contents that people are sharing with their friends or family.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "32", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "So like you said that you like, tell the users to select the data so like, how do you use this data and the feedback which you get from users to improve their podcast experience.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "33", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Okay, okay, so okay, so basically, we give the users every once in a while. And a question about whether did you enjoy this podcast? Or what other stuff are you interested to listen in? So that you know, a user at the end of the day? Watches only what he's fed by the algorithm. And we really don't wanna restrict this since you know, at the end of the day certain fields can get boring after you listen to that particular topic for a long time in a podcast so we try and diversify this way by offering them fresh and new content every time they log on. And yeah, this is done. Using our aiml algorithms in the back end, which is done by a team of about 300 developers.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "34", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Oh, I see!", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "35", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Yeah.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "36", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Oh, that's so good. so so like. How would you then encourage the the spotify new users to like engage more with podcasts? Because. you know, spotify like, as you know, spotify has a lot of different categories like music, and like, has lot of various categories of you know, entertainment. So. and how do you ensure that people engage more in podcast.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "37", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Okay, okay. So we try. And you know, within the podcast itself, like, we'll have a share button or a rate button, for example. And so this kind of tells users who are currently looking at that podcast about how others feel about it and we also started this new feature, basically where you know, anyone and everyone can create their own playlists and people can like and even save that playlist for a matter of fact. So a particular playlist can have, you know, let's say, a, podcast that talks about geopolitics. Let's say so this also really helps try and bring communities together, communities of users. And we also try and create a theme based groups and forums. Basically like, I explained. And we also started recently hosting live events. So offering live podcast sessions and QA, with creators.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "38", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "I see. So I, I can see that you are pretty dynamic in that area then so yeah, like, now, now I'll ask about, like some challenges which you face. So how do you generally address the challenge of content, saturation on the platform to ensure that users can easily discover new podcast like, I'm pretty sure you have a a lot of new like lot of users who post content regularly. So pretty sure pretty sure you would reach at a saturation level. How do you manage that?", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "39", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Right? Right? Great question. So that's where you know our sort of collaboration with the creators comes in. So we really don't wanna constrict our platform by having just a limited number of creators which people just watch them. And basically them having a monopoly over our platform. So last month itself we bought over 2,000 new creators on our platform, offering them great deals which other platforms would not offer them so this is one thing, and another thing like I mentioned previously was, you know, sort of enhancing a recommendation in such a way recommendation system in such a way that people don't just get what they ask for. They also get something more unique. So let's say, for example, you know. Let's say me. For example, I love watching conspiracy theory documentaries. So what spotify also offered me. As a matter of fact, yesterday was. you know, breaking down one of the movies which was related to conspiracy theory. So this in turn, basically led me down another rabbit hole of starting to watch a movie related podcasts and opening up that door for me, which was in in my definitely something that I really enjoyed. And yeah, by offering users open ended questions every now and then, and giving them something refreshing to watch is. you know how we try and avoid saturation.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "40", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Hmm! I see. So like like so pretty sure there would be some like situation where monetization goals like conflict conflict with the in content integrity, like, just as you said that you have a like, you have to manage the saturation level. So how do you handle the content? Integrity basically.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "41", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Oh, yeah, yeah, for sure. I think this would be prevalent in any company in this day and age. So yeah, so what we try and focus on is not pushing, you know, too many ads and essentially disrupting the users listening experience. So we place ads usually just at the start or just at the end of podcasts. And so let's say, I, wanna place 4 ads, I won't place them. You know, in between the podcast I'll put 2 of them 2 30 seconds at at the start of the podcast and 2 30 seconds at at the end of the podcast this just ensures a positive user experience, you know. So yeah. And another thing that we try and focus on is giving. You know, people don't like seeing ads. But what you know, what's the best way around it? What's the worst evil? It is basically targeting the advertising, you know, giving the users something that might be useful to them at 1 point or another. And we also are very transparent with our users about. You know the art, sponsored contents and advertisements. So this clear labeling helps us maintain the trust between users and the platform.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "42", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Oh, I see. So I got the idea from that. So like also like, could you share some of the examples of like platform limitations that influence your strategy. And, like are there any specific features you wish were different.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "43", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Oh, okay, great question. So yeah. One of the features that you know, I wish we did sooner was bringing on people from multiple ethnic backgrounds. And you know, varying languages onto our podcast while we just focused majorly on the English speaking audience. So in terms of scalability, that's what we've started. Now, we've slowly started to onboard people from all over the world onto our platform. When it comes to tech. I guess. you know, the usual scalability challenges. While we try and implement more AI driven recommendation systems and stuff. We really don't wanna process such huge amounts of data that it kind of ruins the user experience because of the low, latent high latency and the low loading times due to the you know the computationally expensive resources that it takes. And you know, we also one thing that was a technical limitation on our side was not enabling the accessibility stuff which I mentioned earlier, so supporting multiple languages, allowing the users to navigate, spotify via voice or via their keyboards. So this is one thing that we really avoided and have recently started implementing. And yeah, one thing that I haven't mentioned is maintaining consistent sort of behavior throughout all the devices, you know. Be it an ipad or Samsung mobile phone or an apple phone we try and ensure the apps. Performance is consistent throughout all the devices.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "44", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "I see. So like, basically, as you said, like, spotify would like Spotify's platform is on various user environments. So like, how do you adapt to the different user environments like, are there any environment, specific features or challenges that you're currently addressing.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "45", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "No great question. Great question. So yeah. Yeah. As a matter of fact, let's get a bit technical with this. So we previously had a common sort of back end infrastructure for our you know, for our web based desktop app and our phone. And you know, this idea, this wasn't really ideal for us, since. You know, the phone has only so much of memory and RAM at 1 point of time compared to a chunky laptop. So we had to sort of branch out and keep the 2 entities separate the mobile sort of code base and our web Ui code base. So at the end of the day, our objective is to optimize our algorithms, such that you know, basically, we don't want to sacrifice our functionality and get more efficient day by day. And we also offer a very regular rollouts, if you've noticed. So over the course of 2 months, we, you know, have some or the other update where we implement a new feature. For example, last month. We just came out with this sleep timer thing. So a lot of people listening to listen to podcasts just before sleeping. So they can set up a timer of about 10 to 15\u00c2\u00a0min before listening before starting, the podcast and the podcast would just stop at the 15th minute So we got a pretty good user feedback from that. And you know, we invest a lot on our infrastructure. And our software and data science teams, we regularly hire them from top colleges and ensure that our developers are also happy and content at the end of the day. So yeah.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "46", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "So, as you said that you invest a lot in developers, and to make sure your users are engaged so like like, can you just walk me through your vision for the ideal user journey in discovering and engaging with podcasts like, yeah, like, what specific Ui, ux changes like, are you planning to implement, to achieve your vision.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "47", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Great question. So one kind of ui, you exchange, you can say, is, we are trying to minimize our click so for example, to reach to a podcast earlier, a person had to click a search button. There wasn't a search bar to begin with. So the search button then led to opening the search bar where the user would type. Now, we've just integrated the search bar directly in our ux, which, looks a whole lot cleaner. And also the sharing options is something that I've discussed. That we've really improved upon. So you know, users can directly just send Instagram or Whatsapp messages onto their respective groups about whatever they like. and it appropriately, cap captures. The Pictorial represents representation as well of the particular of the particular podcast that they're listening to you know this in terms, basically at the end of the day. You know, these small small user experiences at the end of the day. Just make them happy and be on our platform. so yeah, we have also been you know, playing around a lot with the aim lately. So we give users, these sort of daily mixes which are kind of podcast that are new to them and that we think that they like listening to. And yeah, in short, just making the Ui whole lot smoother with lesser clicks. And just improving the accessibility aspect of it as well like voice commands are a big thing now and navigating around with the keyboard and stuff like that. Yeah.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "48", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "So, okay, I got the idea from there. So like, spotify is just not like, spotify is a like very big company and handles a lot of different category. So like, how does the spotify podcast features and features like. who do you mainly target for the podcast features. And how do you? How do their needs differ from the music? Only listeners. So quick, you know, overview of that.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "49", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Okay, okay, great. So the thing is, we, we can be a whole lot risky with the music. The people who listen to music. We can just you know, give them so, for example, a person listening to pop there is. You know, you really can't say whether they would like metal or not, so we just throw it out there and kind of you know, that helps us track whether throwing this random genre of music out there helps them. or rather gives us details to whether this sort of unique genre is something that they would like or not. Now, this kind of thing we can't really do in the podcast space like let's say a guy. You know, let's say, it's a a person who likes listening to spiritual podcasts. We can't just all of a sudden just throw in a regular day, in a life of a Youtube vlogger podcast that just wouldn't work. So we have to be a whole lot subtler with it, I think. Kind of give them more avenues like I said previously to explore, but that the ones that do not deviate too much. And you know all this is handled using our machine learning algorithms. And the huge amount of data that we have. Yeah.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "50", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Right? Right? Got it. So yeah, it's a pretty, you know.

So what kind of improvements or like, what is the one feature that you want to prioritize to you know, improve your podcast platform.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "53", "speaker": "Stakeholder", "text": "Okay? Great question again. So you know, there's not really one specific feature that I would target. I would. You know, it's it's like a basket of things, and you at the end of the day, don't want to leave anything behind. So while our main focus is on the recommendation systems at the moment. We really don't want to compromise on the Ui ux, for example, or you know, our oh, basically, navigation experience, or the small little things out there. But if you really had to ask me, one thing is yeah, like, I said, it's probably our user recommendation system, since at the end of the day we want users to be on our platform and not move to something like Youtube music, just because they did not like the content that we offered to them.

So generally my process starts with an aggregator. I generally have 3 to 4 aggregators that I take a look at. I start off with using skyscanner. I put in a few of the like. I generally do country to country pairs, or like a relative area of the destination to the relative area of sorry relative area of the origin to the relative area of the destination. So like nearby airports, potential dates. So I try to mix it up with all sorts of options. and if I'm finding something that I'm liking, I might search for that in more detail. Let's say I'm liking a certain city pair, or I'm liking a specific date. Then I might search for options around that I look around the timings that are available. how that would factor it into whether I have to book a hotel. How does that connect with other modes of transport? So let's say I'm flying into a city, but then I have to travel to a different city by like a train, or something like that which is pretty common for me back home in India. So I try to plan out my travel, such that things fall into place, and I don't end up having to stay in a city for like 20\u00c2\u00a0h doing nothing. So my 1st priority starts with getting the price down, getting the city pairs slash country pairs down. Then I move on to the dates. and finally onto like time and overall logistics. That's that's the way I do it. Once I have a set of flights like in mind that are my ideal options. Then, depending on how expensive they are, I might check out other aggregators like Google flights, Kayak. There are bunches of them. That you can take a look at if it's not that expensive, then I'll just go through one of the platforms that are part of like skyscanner so bunch of different travel companies partner with skyscanner and have their prices come through. And I'll look at my ideal flights. I'll go to the actual providers website. I'll check out how much it costs me. I'll check out what sort of coupon options I have upgrade options I have. I'll just make sure all the terminal, all the logistics. Information is correct. I also sometimes check out providers directly without going through an aggregator. Sometimes you can get a better discount that way. So there's a lot of research that goes into it before I finally make the decision to book a flight. It's a pretty involved process. I end up taking, like at least an hour or so, just to scar out different options, combinations to find. What's the you know? Potential best option for booking. Once I've finalized on an itinerary and on a provider. I just fill out my information. If they need my passport details, my date of birth. My legal name and other details fill out the declaration forms. And I just pay the amount through my credit card website.

So there's like a forum called Flyer. Talk right. There's a lot of different tricks that you end up getting to know about.

So I prefer going the anonymous route, especially when I'm searching for flights, that is, unless I'm booking with points because you just can't book flights with points without while still being anonymous.

You, as you travel with them, or with any of their partners, through what are called alliances, you end up getting points on them, and with those points. Slash miles. You can book what are called non revenue tickets tickets without actually paying for them. So it's basically like a reward that you get on your credit card. It's a reward for being a customer of that service of that airline and using it frequently. So for those you would need to log into the airline website to check the availability on whatever itinerary that you've decided on.

There are specialized 3rd party applications which aggregate the results from different airlines telling you where it costs less miles or points so that you can make a better decision on that front. But I don't personally use those. So if I have to make a points or an award booking, I'd log on to the airline that I have a loyalty account with where I have my points.

So the best is like a more medium section, like something that balances between price and the time taken.

But I could walk through a potential scenario with you. For example, let's say I'll give you a common example that used to happen with me. My university bachelor's university was in Vellor, and the closest airport ended up being Chennai. and to get to my home I ended up flying to Kolkata. so I would end up regularly, flying between Chennai and Kolkata, and the cheapest flight and the most convenient for me usually worked out to be the night flight. and it used to land at around 1020 pm. Now, to get from the airport to the train station where my the last train for the day would be leaving would be at 1145 pm. So I would run into a situation where I only had, like an hour, 20\u00c2\u00a0min gap. From the time I landed to the time I had to make on this make it on the station. So this was a logistical challenge for me, because I knew it was like a 50 50 situation. I knew half the times I'd make it half the times I didn't, which is, which is what actually ended up happening. So it was a risk. If I had a better option available, something that just maybe lands like 1\u00c2\u00a0h earlier, so that I would be able to make sure that I get home that night, and I don't miss my train, and I don't end up having to stay up for like 6, 7\u00c2\u00a0h, waiting for the next train early in the morning. Then I would go for that option. but it again depends on the price differential. If the price. Differential was way too high. Then I just couldn't afford to like, you know. Spend that much extra as a college student for the luxury of potentially not missing my train. as my time was cheaper compared to actual money. so I think priorities change with time.

But it's very difficult to come up with accurate rules for exactly what you want. because flight prices are very dynamic as well as your life. Situations are also pretty dynamic. I might think that. Oh, I'm going to fly to XYZ. And suddenly, within 2 days I booked my ticket, but my plan completely changes because some something else happened in my life. So it's it's kind of hard for these websites to also sort of predict what I would do, and let me know at an ideal time where maybe the cost is low for the exact itinerary that I want to take.

You are going to see like in details like, what part of your assignment received better grade like a subgrade. And what part of it is not as good. So you can see a detailed decomposition of your assignment like grading that that is, sometimes pretty back. indirect feedback that that kind of really helps. Another feature is Like, for example, in cameras, you can see a real time estimated grade for your previously submitted and graded assignments that one is also like. an indirect feedback that can be helpful to decide like how much time you are going to spend on the course, and whether or not you are going to try an extra extra credit to try to boost your grades.

Another obstacle. I have found that. for example, I only when I'm use gray scope, I can submit a recreate request whenever I think. Oh, maybe that comment is wrong or not applicable to my assignment, so I should not be have a minus point here.

So I think in in most cases there's going to be some large company that's going to host all of these videos on their servers.

So I'll talk about it on a per user basis. So as a viewer first, st so for me, I think it's essential to be able to try to get a specific type of video or content by searching via text, or perhaps by filters of some sort. and secondly, to be able to search visually, so I would like to be able to see a large volume of different options and click through it, seeing, perhaps by all sorts of science fiction, or all sorts of live sports. and I can walk through that seeing little images of a thumbnail, so to speak, with a description, perhaps, who made it, the Creator, or the actors in it, or so on, and so forth. and then the other half of it would be from the streamer, or somebody uploading for them. I would want to see some option where I could go and create to upload a video or start a stream. And I would want to be able to either. Take that video, put some sort of description in, add, perhaps a transcript captions of the like. and one thing, I think would be very useful, particularly in a video streaming would be to edit those.

I think some simple obstacles might be not finding what I'm looking for. even if it hypothetically should exist.

I'm going to use a generic video streaming service. So I've opened it up. And now I'm looking at a home screen that has a number of videos that may be relevant to me. They are listed as small thumbnails where, when I hover over them. I see a little snippet of the content. I would watch. and they come with a title that I can click on to play, said video. They come with the Creator, who, if I click on that, it will go to their account. And I can see some statistics such as views. I see creation date. So now I'm able to start scrolling down where I'm seeing these same thumbnails with a longer description as well, and I can click through using little arrows in order to go one to the next, those arrows meaning to the right hand side of the image. I can click on a little triangle arrow thing. It gets a hover graphic. So it shows that my mouse is over it. The mouse cursor has changed. and now I can click through it to see different content until I reach the end at which point the arrow disappears, and there are no more options. So now I'll try doing a search. So at the very top of the screen I see a home button, hamburger menu. So the the triple line that lets me see some more options. A central search bar with a little magnifying glass. Search button. I see a search with your voice option which I could use. and then I see on the right hand side of the top bar, a creation button, a little plus sign inside a video camera icon that could be used for video uploads. And I see my account. So I'll go to the central search and I'm going to search up basketball videos for reasons unknown. I don't like basketball, so we're here I now see what's starting off is a a sponsored ad for football. Then I am seeing some various basketball game highlight reels where it's similar to what I described before, but the thumbnail is much bigger. Taking up half width of the screen within its row. I can keep scrolling down to see various options of what I'd like of other basketball games. And I'm also seeing every 10th or so is a sponsored ad. Okay?

There's also the option to go live. which it's another option. since I've never done this before. It's prompting me for what my account might be. I quickly create that create. So now I have a channel, and my options are loading. Here we are. So I I get to a account creation or a Channel creation page, I should say. where I can click a central create button. That is right in the middle of my page, and it says, Create any content. So once I click on that. I am prompted to upload a file of my choice. and then I am asked to give a title in a little box. I'm asked to give a description. and I am asked for some other information, like languages and things of that nature.

And there's a go live option as opposed to a create video. So when you click. go live. They are asked to give 24\u00c2\u00a0h notice in order to be allowed to stream. So this back to your original question of some sorts of security and compliance things.

I think they have the capability to add things to their watch list. or they can perhaps follow or subscribe to various types of content. so they can, as I mentioned before, go to the accounts or creators and click on a subscribe button, at which point they can access.

And now my screen is the video player in the center, where along the bottom there is a play button, which, when clicked, turns into a pause button, and that toggles back and forth to the right of that. There's a next button. If I click this, it will give me the next video it suggests. which. when not part of a playlist. This uses some sort of internal recommendation algorithm. After that I'm given a a mute, unmute button again, which can be toggled. And there's a a slider widget which allows me to control the volume manually using a a graphical, not numeric sense. After that I'm seeing a a time. So how much time has gone through the video. So far, so number of seconds. And next to that, it's like current time. Slash total time length. Now.

Otherwise the screen is just the video when in full screen mode and in terms of disabilities.

So yeah, it will like warn me like, for example. Now, there is a typhoon happening in Taiwan, for example, and it's like warning me there like there are weather events of tornadoes in in the Us.

Usually I'm not sure like, cause I have not been in a weather event in a city where there was a weather event, extreme weather event.

Usually like you have an idea like you know, couple of weeks before you're going somewhere that you'll be going there. So yeah, I immediately. Once I find that I'll be going. I either check for historical data if it's available somewhere, or I check for future weather focus because it gives you focus. That's you know, I had like monthly forecast as well. So you at least have a good estimate of what the what the weather will be like. and and not just like the temperature and precipitation. As I mentioned earlier, but also like the cloud coverage, like, if you're going for a beach vacation, let's say, and it's going to be super cloudy. Then, you know, you might need to reconsider, because usually people go there to enjoy sun. Right? So yeah, so stuff like that, you'll definitely check if there is some. I don't know if you're going for some astronomical event trip right like, if you're going in a hillside to like absorb some astronomical event. but it's like overshadow or like the there is an overcast like, there are a lot of clouds, basically. So it might have to cancel the trip. So stuff like that, you can at least start seeing a few weeks before, and then, as you approach the date, the weather, like the weather forecast, becomes usually more accurate.

So viney.com has a very good radar section. I mean, the entire app is just a radar, and it it gives a lot of details. And I really love seeing the animations. So maybe that. And coming to a second point about trail events. Sorry whether at trails or something like that. I think that would also be a good feature. Because, you know, sometimes it's not necessarily like a city that you're going to, or a state that you're going to you. You just want to like, see whether at this particular hotel that's in like middle of nowhere. For example, then, like, How would you check it? Right?

Actually, I I have tried. Like many different ide tools like, for example, I have used sublime. I have used item, I have used Vs code something like that. But why? Why do I choose vein? Actually, the 1st reason is, I think being is cool because you have to like like coding in Terminal, and that makes me feel I'm the kind of hacker or something. and but for more practical reason, is that actually, when the develop developer may have, like many like opportunity. You have to work at different machines. And and actually, each machines, the building tool to to coding is actually beam. There's no Vs code. There's no something like that. There's no other things, and if you get used to like 2 personal tools, you'll you'll be. You'll find it difficult to like to code in in every single machine, and also vim is very like, it's very light, and it opens. You can open like very quick. And it it just works at every like every server. Perfectly. So when I develop something, when I have to like change some things at at the server, I can just easily open the vim and and modify the code, and when, when, if I if I don't get used to the vim, I may find difficulty to easily modify codes on the server. And that actually matters much. Yeah. So so for me, I choose to like in my personal, in my local development environment, I will, I will. I will like customize them to to. I will install a bunch of like cool plugins. I will like, customize the interface to make it. Just look really cool and like like fit to my my personal like experience. But I can also use the plain bin to to coding to modify any files in any server, and I think that is, that is the most important strengthens to get used to being, and that is why I choose beam to to deal with my every everyday daily challenge. Yeah.", "goals": null, "actions": null}, {"turn": "16", "speaker": "Interviewer", "text": "Okay, so I have a few questions on what you just said because, I think I didn't exactly get it.

We had only has the tech space command line. and also the beam is wrong. That that that interface. So so, yeah, so so the Mo. Most important thing is that when you need to access in machines like server, this don't have a user interface on it. and you can only run vim on the terminal, because you can only access to the command line interface. There is no user interface. There's no graphic interface on the server. So you can. You can never run run Vs code or sub line in such a such server.

And when when you, when you when you have to like open like sub one or Vs code, it also like, relate to what I what I talk about about a user interface. You have to like. The server has to render it at a desktop. and it will. It will definitely cause to like open it slower, because, the the system has to process the the user interface to let it like pop out in a in a in the screen. And you can like, resize it or do anything on it. And actually, being is just a plain editor embed in terminal. So so the system actually make no difference to a system to like, render it on the screen, because all of it are just text based. There's no user interface. You cannot resize it, or whatever you you can. You can do it in the terminal in in certain way, but the system don't have to render it so that that just make make the speed way more faster when you use them. And if you have using Vs cord, or any kind of like graphical interface editor, you will. You will see it costs like like RAM usage or or CPU usage. It usually costs a lot.

So basically, when I mentioned around being on on my local environment is run by on my local terminal. Okay? Okay? So so okay, so also, for how do I customize this? Every like, every veem every everything has a has a config file in your system. Once you open it, it will like create a default, config, file in your in your like home directory, and it is hidden. But you can. You can like open it, and and every every config is is written down in that config file. So, including install plugins. There's a bunch of like plugin tools for bin and for for my workflow. I can just open the config file, and I can include include the Plugin tool. And actually, the installing of the Plugin is just a 1 line. I I just need to like, include the Plugin Plugin tool and tell the plugin tool what Plugins I use, and I and I execute the command. Something like Plugin install or something. and the system will it just install that Plugin and the Plugin will be it actually just a folder in your like in your along with your base Bs Bs code, files. And yeah, so so it is. It is also relatable about the light lightweight things. Because, if you like, keep your config file, you can. You can, make every system just like your local local customization. If you keep that config file that like, if you put put it in the server and and the server will will be just like your local beam.

And actually the Plugin can do like many things, for like, for example, I can, I can install like fuzzy search in in my, in my vein, and when when I use fuzzy search I can like I can. I can bind bind the the open file into some some keyboard shortcut, and and it will like open open a interface that I can type which file. I want to search and let Leverage the fuzzy search to search the file I want. and then I can. And then, using that tool, I can just open each file like very quick, and it will like pop out like like a like a tabs, just like other like normal editors. So I can. I can. I can easily just manage many files in vein, and also for plugins also been also supports like copilot. and I can, I can. I can easily, like, integrate compiler in in my theme. So when I, when I coding it, will like pop out the AI generated code that suggests me to to execute, to to implement.

Like, for, for example, I'm working on quality assurance projects recently for our class and my, my typical workflow is that I will open my terminal and I will open Tmox. Tmox is another like like application in the terminal. You can like open every different windows in your terminal. and I will open. Tmox and I will split the tmox split the window into half, and one is for command line one is for vim. Okay? So okay. So when I I when I want to open the beam, I will. I will 1st go to the Directory where the project is, and I will. I will just open a file, and and the command is very easy, like theme like Project Dot Json something like that. and you can just open the file and after open a file. Every issue I will. I will like open another plugin called file tree. It will. It will just show a a file, a file structure in in a pane of in in your, in your name, and that that looks like the pain, and that that just looks like every like every editor. Yeah. I will. I will open the the file tree and I will the file tree. I can open files in the file tree, and I can also open files using fuzzy search. And I will. I customize my fuzzy search into like simple, like keyboard shortcut like control. P is open the file in this project, and like control, E is select the the file that already be opened by the bin that is called buffer similar to similar to tab in in different editor. Yeah. And like, for example, yeah, control P for open new file to add new files in the vein and control E is to like switching between different buffer and like I will, I will use like backslash P to to do the search across different different files. And I will quickly locate the the target file I want. And yeah, and and after, like I modify the calls I will. I will use in Tmox to switch to another window. That is, the coming line is, and I will execute the code. There, I can. I can just see the result immediately. And there's any like bugs or error. I can just switch back to Vin page. So so yeah, so basically, my workflow everything I can, I, everything I need I can down in the terminal. And I can also store the store. The process of the team up. So if I computer, just get shut down or anything, I can just resume back to my process like immediately. So yeah, yeah, that is basically my workflow and example. I I hope I explain it.

And and there, there's actually there. There's of course, there's some some official document about beam Internet. But but no one will read through that and and start to using beam. So so actually, actually, I just, I just like watch many like Youtube videos. And there will be, like many many people like introduce their how are you using? Because because everyone's workflow in beams actually different, because it's like, it's like highly customizable tools to to let you develop your code. So yeah, so actually, I just I, just, I just see so many people's workflow. And and I, I try to like force myself to get used to it, and eventually you will develop a like kind of like muscle memory. It was like, just you, you can just like switch switch files like modify code, or or get getting here, getting there like really, really quick. And after you pass through that learning curve, and you'll you'll find out using vime is very like satisfiable things, because cause that that the cause, the efficiency is totally different when using user interface, you don't have to like, use your mouse to to select this. Select that everything you do is on the keyboard, and you can. Your your hands will never like. Leave your keyboards, and you can, you can finish everything on it. So yeah, so the beginning struggle, but but after like, like reading every many people's experience, and also there, there's a bunch of there's a great, a very huge community for vim. You can. You can easily like, like, find some instructions or some arrows. You can, you can find a solution in stack, overflow, and and like, for nowadays, actually, the vim config file you can. You can just ask Gpt to to help you modify this. It is very, very useful. I mean, it's a it's a game changer like before the Gpt. The most struggles thing is to like to to sort to figure out how how like config file works. So that's a whole different language. But but nowadays, I think, using them, the learning curve is actually it's easier to learn it right now. Yeah, comparing like, like, 5 years ago, I guess. Yeah. So the process is pretty like it's it's a it's a it's an adventure, I guess. Yeah. But but now I I already get used to it. I use it every day.

So actually, for the 1st reason, the the main reason is when I started, use me. I'm about like, like, 20 years ago, 20 years old. And I just I just think spin is so cool like like, if you like doing this, it just looks like the hacker. And you you feel like, open your terminal and the Starbucks, and you just you just you just feel so good. That's just a teenager things to me. But but actually. Another reason is that there's so many people in the community, the developer community, or they? There are so many people recommend themes, and I know there's a bunch of like like like very famous developer, like like the inventor of C, plus plus. I forget his name, but he also used beam, and, like many, many like old old school superstar engineer, use vime, and everyone recommended, and everyone just say the learning curve is deep, but you have to get past free, and you will get very comfortable. So actually, those kind of things just supported, supported me to like, try to get used to it. And I I kind of, I kind of like, very satisfied about it, like, currently. But yeah, but actually, this is not a topic. But, like recently, I gradually find find like being is it's it's like actually, for for now I think, Vs code, or something like that, will gradually pass, being cause cause. You can also make Vs code like very similar to your vim. And I think it's like 2024. Nobody has has time to like to like sort things out like in a config file that's actually complicated. And and also when you have to develop like front end stuff and the front end stuff. Just need your editor to to like, show some some colors, something like that. And being couldn't support that. And yeah, so especially for for front end development, I won't recommend using being currently. But you can. Maybe you can sort things out. I don't know but that that will cost that will cost cause like much effort. Yeah. Yeah. But but basically, I still using me is another option. And it also also helps you to develop on the server.

Yeah, I think, yeah, I think the developer the cool developer. He can, like, like, source, manage, everything's out just using the keyboard. You can like, switch, just just typing in the keyboard. Yeah. And that's actually oh, I think it's cool. Yeah. But but now I am like, I'm about to get 30 years old. So I actually, I don't care about how cool I am anymore. Right now. Yeah, yeah. But yeah, but I still like, I get used to it. So I will keep using it and actually actually keep keeping your hands on the keyboard. Just do improve your efficiency.

I was, I was working on my my master, my master project, because I I got a master degree back years ago. And and when I yeah. Yeah. So so when I, when I like, need to like doing the project doing some real project that will affect your maybe your salary or your graduation, and you will force yourself to learn it. And and yeah, so and I actually I think it takes like like one month or 2 months to to let me can can, like successful, successfully develop things by vein. But but you have. It has to like, take years to like fully integrate yourself into that system, because, cause you will like the your like, your plugins, your your tools, you you will like, gradually increase like I didn't use Tmox that much in the beginning when I use them. But but actually, tmox and vin, you have to like combine both of them to to maximize your efficiency. So so, yeah, so the improvement, actually, actually, the learning curve is steep is steep. But the improvement you you will get gradually improvement. And actually, you will take years, because because it's muscle memory. But yeah, but but in fact, if you, if you learn it, learn something slow and you will never forget it. So it's actually, yeah, this kind of like, like memory will like building in my muscle.

I think Vs code is very, very good, because actually, Vs code can integrate so many things like you can integrate your aws server, you can integrate your Github actions. You can. You can just simply combine the whole Cicd process in Vs code, and that is actually very, very helpful. And what I what I mentioned about the relation of Vs code and being. And how how do I like like review my workflow right now? Is that actually, you can install being plugins in Vs code. and you will just. And you you can in Vs code, can perfectly integrate with by your beam config file so you can. You can like like easily turn turn your Vs code just looks like your beam and also leverage the the strengthness or Vs code like like it also has a bunch of extension, and is so easy to customize, and it has it. Can. It can like integrate so many Ci CD things and github things something like that. And that is that is what I talked about. The comparison between Veeam and Vs code nowadays. Yeah, cause I think eventually Vs code. Actually, actually, I think, Vs code already passed. Veen right now, because it is so, it is like, so it is like so complete for developer. You can only use use Vs code to to like to to complete everything. But if you choose to use mean, you have to like customize so many things you have to like, install so many things you have to. You have to keep growing your your customized file. You have to keep it. You have to like, make it portable to every, every, to every device. And that is actually that pretty pretty mess. And for Vs code, you can just you can just use the account and and all of your setting will store in that account, and you can activate your setting on every device that is way more easier. So yeah, so so actually, for nowadays for me, I I don't use being like I don't. I don't like only using. I also use Vs code for some some sort of scenario and also for compiler Vs code actually integrates compiler better than being can also, like Vin can can just like do some some suggestion of the code. But Vs code there, there's a copilot plugin. You can just simply like, select a bunch of a bunch of piece of code. And you you can select like, like, which which file you have to look for for the AI tool. And you can just easily, like, like, tell you how to modify your code. So yeah, for nowadays, I actually, I actually start to learn how to use Vs code. Right now, yeah, for for better efficiency. Yeah, cause, yeah, cause eventually, all the developer we all we want is efficiency and which tool give us better efficiency. We will use that that tool. So that is basically simple.

I can still use me because I know how to use Vin, and I can make Vs code just looks like my vin. So I can use like, just just identical to my vin shortcut to develop in, to develop in Vs code and actually, Vs code nowadays, just leverage both the strengthless of being and and a user interface. Yeah. And and the interface is pretty good right now. Yeah, so yeah, so basically, if you used to ask my opinion, I think Vs code is a perfect perfect tool for developers right now. Yeah. But I still, I still enjoy coding in terminal. Actually, I still think it's cool. Yeah. So yeah, so for me, I don't think we need to like like, stick to a single tool for a developer.

If the editor can support like syntax, highlighting can support like like auto suggestion, and you can. You can ease easily manage your file, and that is actually sufficient. Yeah, as actually sufficient for editor. But but nowadays, actually, actually, I think the requirement is is created by the product cause cause. Nowadays. Vs. Code, you can like manage like so many things on on a single app, like, for example, like 10 years ago, the developer. Maybe they they have to like like use use any editor to modify the code, and they have to use the command line to like, like, build the code like or deploy the code, and you have. They have to like, like, go to the the azure, or aws page to to see how it goes to manage the the the infrastructure of the whole system. And and yeah, that actually, the whole devops looked like like from develop from Co review, from from monitoring, from testing people pre, people like 10 years ago. They they use they they do those things by different interface. Like they they code in in editor and do the testing on maybe some sort of web interface and do the code Review do the the server things on the editor something like that. But nowadays actually, vs, culture integrate. Everything's everything's the every like like the whole pipeline is integrating Vs code like, like. like, for example, start at coding. And you start and you build code and you integrate your test framework and you deploy it to your server. And actually, you can do code review on Vs code.

And and I I will use the terminal to like, build a code to test it and and push it to the code base like Github. And after after that I will like open my browser to like, for example, to go Github like or to review others, others code to like merge code into into our product branch something like that. And I will use, and and after the code is done we have to like deploy to a system. So maybe I will use the the browser to open like something like Jenkins, or something like that. I will use such of tools to to trigger the trigger. The command on the server. The server will automatically pull the code from the code base and build the the production code on the server, and it will run it, and and then I will use the browser to to open like maybe aws to see the status of the machine. And I will like go to the real production page to see how it goes. and maybe maybe I will use some, maybe something like data docs or Kibana to monitor the production situation to see is there any errors or or did? Is there, like real real customer use are using the production call something like that. And so yeah, so basically, my workflow is before. Just for the code, the the development phase. I will stick to the terminal. But after that, basically everything I need to use my browser to finish that. And and yeah, in in comparison. In comparison.

I will like I for for now, for me personal, I will. I will just try to like get used to every tool that that I can. I can both. I can leverage both methods. So I can like, look at every device.

I can see Whoa. There is some monetary things there's there's some stats, there's some health check. And all of those things can can be seen on the Vs code.

It's document. And you can see the whole community discuss about it. You can see the ratings.

More specifically, a centralized social media platform. E.g. \"The main goal is to have an interface that feels intuitive right from the first use. Right now, some areas feel like users are guessing instead of navigating.\"\n* Clarification on features: There are features within some social media that could be more intuitive for users, particularly those features such as Reddit, which may be extremely confusing when a user first onboards. E.g. \"Some features aren't self-explanatory. We get questions about how to find or use them, especially on Reddit. Making this more clear would help.\"\n* Enhancement of engagement: There's a need to increase user engagement by further simplifying navigation across screens. \"If we could make it easier to access features, I think people would use it more often. Right now, it's kind of buried in the menu options.\"\n* Workflow efficiency: There's also a need to reduce the number of steps needed to complete common tasks, \"It takes too many clicks to complete a simple action. Reducing this would make it more efficient for users who need to do this frequently.\"\n* Further customization: Adding customization capabilities to allow user to tailor their experience based on individual preferences. E.g. \"A lot of people have different needs, so it would be ideal if they could customize the view or layout to fit their preference better.\"\n* Reduction on errors: Adding a clearer error reporting mechanism, will enable users to easily report issues they encounter. E.g. \"Users sometimes encounter glitches, especially when going through feeds on Reddit. If we can reduce those, it'll make the experience more reliable.\"\n\nActions:\n* Feature simplification: There's a recurring need to simplify features that currently require multiple steps, aligning with\nthe goal of efficiency.\nE.g. \"We need to simplify navigation in Reddit, maybe by removing redundant steps. It should\njust be a straightforward process without extra screens.\"\n* User guidance: Implementing in-app tutorials or hints will help users navigate complex features, addressing the\ngoal of feature clarity. E.g. \"\"Some sort of guided help would be beneficial. Like if we could have a short introduction or\nprompt when they use a feature for the first time.\"\n* Need to test for usability:  Conducting more comprehensive testing that is focused on real user scenarios to identify pain\npoints. E.g. \"It would be helpful to test these features with actual users doing realistic tasks, not just our\ninternal teams, to catch any unexpected issues.\"\n* Iterative feedback collection: Gathering ongoing feedback from users to continuously adapt the app based on their needs. E.g. \"Gathering feedback periodically would let us know sooner if users are having trouble or if\ntheir needs change.\"\n* Optimization for performance: Improving the app's load times and responsiveness will prevent users from being frustrated, especially with high-engagement features. E.g. \"One action we could take is optimizing load times. Some areas lag, especially on X, which can frustrate users.\"\n* Error reporting and resolution: Adding a clearer reporting mechanism, will enable users to easily report issues they encounter. E.g. \"Having a simple way to report errors directly from the app would be useful.

Open files and folders in the editor. Modify and save changes. If working on a server without an Interface, then use the editor to modify code without additional setup.\n* Go to community spaces. Get plugin (enhancement) information. Open editor configuration file. Add information to the editor configuration file. Use the plugin in the editor.\n* Edit plugin file. Add keyboard shortcuts for easy access; otherwise, navigation may be slower\n* Do not include many functionalities right out of the box, otherwise editor will be slower than expected. If the user wants to add more functionality, then they can add plugins (mentioned above). Only add things that you want.\n* Get the community to participate in improving the editor. Make content for the community. Access community resources like YouTube tutorials and Stack Overflow. Participate in forums to share knowledge and discover new plugins. If the community suggests certain plugins, then you can install them instantly.\n* Make the editor configuration file simple to use. Transfer and run configuration file from any device; otherwise, settings may not be consistent across environments. Load the same editor from any device with this configuration file.\n* Integrate tools like Tmux (tool to split terminal into multiple terminals) into working well with the editor. Build multiple plugins to support different functionality\n* Develop commonly used functionality like code reviewing tools, monitoring tools. Add these as plugins.
