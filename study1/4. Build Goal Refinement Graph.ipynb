    "# The program describes a goal graph, in which each goal describes a state in the system to be achieved, maintained or avoided. The functions define refinement relationships between two goals X and Y. When goal X is refined by goal Y, then goal Y must be satisfied in order to satisfy the goal X. Refinement relationships are asymmetric. When a goal X is refined by a goal Y, then the goal Y explains how the goal X is satisfied. The goal Y could be one of several steps that must be performed to satisfy goal X, or it could be one of many cases that must be handled to satisfy goal X. Refinement relationships are transitive, thus if a goal Z satisfies goal Y and goal Y satisfies goal X, then it is also true that Z satisfies X. \n",
